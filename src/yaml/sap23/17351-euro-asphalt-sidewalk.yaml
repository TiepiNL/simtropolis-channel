  summary: Euro asphalt sidewalk
  description: |-
    I made this modd to change the existing sidewalk (concrete plates) into a more realistic *asphalt sidewalk*. Many cities and towns in Europe only use this kind of sidewalk. When you use this modd then every area of your city will have the same sidewalk. (no matter if there are rich or poor people living) This fact is not always fully realistic but it matches with my hometown.

    How to install?
    Put the .dat-file into your Plugins-Folder!

    Are there any dependencies?
    No!

    Note: Please do *not* use this sidewalk mod with any other sidewalk modd (if there are any).
