    This mod removes the brown boxes that appear on [RRetail's Meadowbrook Plaza](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/35468-meadowbrook-plaza), even if you downloaded all its dependencies. The brown boxes are caused by a missing model that doesn't seem to be available anywhere. It looks like [@RRetail](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/744613-rretail/) has forgotten to add it to the mega prop packs.

    All you have to do is replace the .SC4Lot files in the <original folder>/RR Meadowbrook Square/ folder with the .SC4Lot files in from this mod. Alternatively you could just paste the .SC4Lot files in your plugins folder and make sure they load *after* RR Meadowbrook Square - for example by putting them in a **zz\_ folder**.
