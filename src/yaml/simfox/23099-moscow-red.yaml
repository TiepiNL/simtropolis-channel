    **mGeneral Info**

    This is a first in the line of re-releases of my BATs that had been adjusted for the darker night views of DAY´n´NITE modd. **Moscow Red** was my first BAT so I though it would be fitting to start at the beginning,  so to say.

    in the ZIP file you'll find new SC4Model File and two sets of LOT files for normal game and for game with CAM modd installed.

    **m****Installation**

    Installation instructions1\. Fresh installation

    move model and one of the set of LOT files into your plugin folder

    2\. Upgrade from Normal Maxis night model.

    find in your plugin folder old model file (SelHoz-0x5ad0e817\_0x135c6ca8\_0xa0000.SC4Model) and replace it with Model file from this release. You can also replace /add desired lots, although this is not required.

    **m****Dependencies**

    Main and essential dependency is

    **[DAY´n´NITE](https://www.simtropolis.com/stex/details.cfm?id=23089)** modd, without it building will not look right in your city

    For CAM lots you would need to download and install:

    [**CAM**](https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=1008) (Colossus Add-on Modd) available on LEX (sc4Devotion exchange)

    These lots have no other dependencies.
