    **Moscow RED** *by SimFox*

    Gentle Folks of Simtropolis!

    I’m honored to preset you my first full featured upload to STEX - Moscow Red.

    Modeled after a residential tower in Moscow this 33 storey building houses 1723 R$$ Sims and if you will manage you city not too good 2723 less fortunate R$ will slam into it.

    I would like to dedicate this building to three people who in a way made me to take up BATing :

    Bixel

    *and*paulvmonfort

    *from HKABT (to which I’m proud to belong)*

    *and also* JasonCW.

    Thank you guys your work had inspired me and brought me so much fun!
