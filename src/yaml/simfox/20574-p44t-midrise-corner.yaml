    **General Info**

    Continuing development of P44T series I present you mid-rise corner residential block.This download contains 2 models (white and "brick" detailing) growing on a 6x6 medium density residential zone.

    Make sure you read ReadMefor guide how to get it to Zone for it and make sure that it grows in appropriate orientation.

    By placing 4 6x6 zones in a square pattern you can form perfect 12x12 mini districts with lush green yards.

    **Dependencies**
