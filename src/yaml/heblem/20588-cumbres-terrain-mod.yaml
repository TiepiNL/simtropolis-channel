  description: |-
    Mexico Terrain Mods (Cumbres Terrain Mod), This is a semi-desert terrain mod, based of the area of Monterrey City and the Sierra de las Cumbres. This file includes a controller where you can set the altitude height, beach height, etc...  
      
    I suggest using [SMP Grey Marble Rock Mod](../../stex/index.cfm?id=17124), that one suits perfect on this terrain mod.  
    Special thanks to C.P. for allow me to include some of his terrain textures on this terrain mod.

    If you download this file please pick one type of terrain mod you want, depending you want snow over it... the normal (or the one that doesn't say hight or low height) that's the no snow version,, the low height is the most covered snow version and high height is the few snow version...  
      
    Enjoy!

    This file only compatible with SimCity 4 "Rush Hour" or SimCity 4 Deluxe.
