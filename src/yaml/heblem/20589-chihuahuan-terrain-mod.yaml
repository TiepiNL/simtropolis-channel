  description: |-
    Mexico Terrain Mods (Chihuahuan Terrain Mod), This is a desert terrain mod, based of the Sonoran, Coahuilan, and Chihuahuan desert located just north of Mexico. This file includes a controller where you can set the altitude height, beach height, etc...

    I suggest your to not use any rock mod, maxis rock mod looks great at this terrain mod, as for water mod its your choice.  
    Special thanks to C.P. for allow me to include some of his terrain textures on this terrain mod.

    If you download this file please pick one type of terrain mod you want, depending you want snow over it... the normal (or the one that doesn't say hight or low height) that's the no snow version,, the low height is the most covered snow version and high height is the few snow version...  
      
    Enjoy!
