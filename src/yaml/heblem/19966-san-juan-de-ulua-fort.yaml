  summary: San Juan de Ulua Fort
  description: |-
    San Juan de Ulúa is a large fortress on an island overlooking the seaport of Veracruz, Mexico. It was built in the Spanish colonial era, starting its construction in 1565. It was expanded several times later. Before the arrival of Spaniards, the island was occupied by people from Nahuatl descendance and it is named in ancient documents as the island of Kahlúa, presumably the origin of the castillianized name of Ulúa. In Nahuatl, Kahlúa means "House of the Acolhua people" (from kalli or calli, 'house' and Acolhua, an ethnic group from the Nahuatl family). source Wikipedia.org
