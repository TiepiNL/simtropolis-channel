  summary: Mall del Sur
  description: |-
    This is a fictional suburban mall based on a mall from Laredo, Texas. This mall contains 8 different department stores that are common in United States malls, such JcPenney, Dillard's, Macy's, Sears, Forever21, H&M, Cinemark and more. It also features some inside details at night, food court and main entrance.

    Due the nature of this lot, I have divided this into 4 different pieces that must be plopped in a correct position. Please see plop and install instructions below.

    This file includes two mall version, one functional CS$$$ landmark and eyecandy, you can use both versions or decide to use only one version. 

    Functional landmark CS$$$ and eyecandy version

    Lot 1 size: 18x15

    Lot 2 size: 14x13

    Lot 3 size: 12x23

    Lot 4 size: 6x10

    Position in the menu: landmarks menu (both functional and eyecandy)

    Wealth: $$$ - High wealth, $$ medium wealth and $ low wealth

    Transit enabled: Yes, use roads in all entrances, and avenue at main entrance.

    **Install:**

    Place all files into your documents/SimCity 4/Plugins

    (watch for lot files ending name "LM" for locate eyecandy lots)

    **Plop instructions:**

    Please look at last screenshot below

    \-Step 1, plop first lot (section 1) anywhere you want (if you rotate the lot, remember how you rotated it, it affects all lots afterwards otherwise don't rotate any of your lots)

    \-Step 2, plop second lot (section 2), make sure to match first lot in a straight line.

    \-Step 3, plop third lot (section 3), it should be easy to plop at the corner generated by the first and second lots.

    \-Step 4, plop fourth lot (section 4), again use the corner from previous lots and make sure to see the straight line from other lots.

    \-Step 5, you done!, make sure to place roads in between the drive inns, it's transit enabled!

    enjoy!
