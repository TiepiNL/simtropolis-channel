  summary: Modern glassy clock tower
  description: |-
    I actually made this a BAT for  my own city, for personal use only so of course it don't exactly have superb textures...,but i thought it would come in handy for anyone frustrated that there's mostly just old style clock towers on STEX,this one should fit quite nicely in a modern area

    Short description: the tower has LCD  screens showing the weather and date and both top and bottom, it mostly covered in glass and it has blue neon lights at night.

    dependencies: None

    Stats: Basicaly the same as the default parks.
