  summary: 1970's Brutalist College
  description: |-
    Another really old model; if you have been on ST long enough, you may remember
    the Sym productions modular university kit that was in the making, that never materialized, but i had several models left from my effort in that project.
    And among them, this tower, inspired by the Brutalist architecture from the 50's to the 70's
    I put quite a lot of work into improving the general quality of the model, with Simhottody's help of course D:

    Stats:
    Plop cost: 25000
    Capacity maxed out: 65000
    Cost per month: 1000
    Lot size 3x3
