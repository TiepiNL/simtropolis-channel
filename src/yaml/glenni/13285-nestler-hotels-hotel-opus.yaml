  description: |-
    Nestler hotels is just a fictional  hotel chain name me and Gingerblokey(he said he was eating  a nestle double cream :S)  made up just for fun.the hotel itself's name is Hotel Opus.who knows...maybe i will release more Neslter hotels.

    The lot is 4x5 Reward lot.it is is TRANSIT ENABLED at the entrance of the driveway but not the whole driveway.you like transit enabling right?I  bet you do!=D

    Something funny:See if you can find  4 Flags on the building that are fictional!

    Thank you:

    To suico for making a lot,transit enabling,making it a reward,rendering,LODding it!.well you can say he did everything apart from the BAT of course=P
