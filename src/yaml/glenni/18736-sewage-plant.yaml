    Are your slum districts polluting the water? Place this and solve the problem.

    This sewage plant was pretty much an experiment in 3dsmax, to check out the new features, uch as water reflections, bump mapping and making  something as realistic looking as I could. It's not modelled to look exactly like a water treatment plant, in fact it doesn't look anything like one.I originally just started with a canal, with sewage water, then it grew into this, This project took me a little over a month to finish, and with Callagrafx's help it was rendered.

    I'm also planning on making a canal set with a matching water colour, but this is all I have done for now.

    Thank you for downloading, and enjoy!
