  summary: Unrealeased BAts set
  description: |-
    These bats are older BATs that i made for SYM productions but never got modded nor released  some of them may not have lights or be on a lot or even run though sc4 plugin manager,anyway i did have more models laying arround but my stupid sc4-hating brother deleted theem and my whole plugins folder, and not to mention the whole sc4....

    i am pretty sure that  The tower block (chavondale) and the  Hampton arms have nightlights,however for the two others,i dont know.

    i would have gladly run them through sc4 for you so they would atleast be props,but my dad put a stop for that a few months ago...He sat on the pc **DRUNK**..sheesh..and that messed up my pc **BIG** time...

    Anyways,enjoy them
