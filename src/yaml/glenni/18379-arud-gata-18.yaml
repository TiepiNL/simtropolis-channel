    Arud Gata 18:

    Arud Gata 18 was built in Vandals Fjella in the street Arud Gata in 1968. It was originally built for office purposes, but slowly the offices on the ground level moved away and shops replaced it. In 1994, it was in a rather poor shape and was unpopular with the locals because of the very stained and ugly concrete walls it had. All the original businesses had closed down and was replaced with seedy ones. Thankfully, in the same year, the building and the street it was located in underwent renovations. The ugly concrete facade the building once had was now replaced with stone cladding, making it slightly more attractive for people. Now the family friendly shops are back and it now has a DNB Nor office (a banking company in Norway), Free Record Shop (A record store chain in Europe), the well known H&M and Cubus, MIX (A Norwegian store chain), Princess (Home accesories shop chain in Norway), and Dress Mann (Clothing shop chain in Norway), as well as other tenants.
