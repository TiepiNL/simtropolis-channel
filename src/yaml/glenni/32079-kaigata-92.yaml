  summary: Kaigata 92
  description: |-
    First building in about 7 years, being a little out of practice i figured I'd choose something nice and simple. A basic 1960s building, fit for European wall to
    wall environments. The name is Norwegian, and means Dock Street 92.

    Stats:

    Size: 1x2
    Wealth: Offices -  Medium/§§
    Bulldoze Cost: 450
    Plop Cost: 5250
    Power Consumed: 10
    Water Consumed: 15
    Jobs §§: 160

    Place the file/folder into mydocuments/simcity4/plugins
    Then paste the building you want, only one works at a time, so make sure you know wether or not you run standard maxis nights, or Simfox's Darknite mod.
