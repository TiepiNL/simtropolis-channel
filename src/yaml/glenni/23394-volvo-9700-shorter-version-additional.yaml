  summary: Volvo 9700 shorter version ADDITIONAL

    **This is a re-upload of the file previously uploaded 17.02.2010.**

    Somehow got deleted. Exact cause unknown.  Having been talking to Zelgadis about this we've come to the conclusion that it's somehow his fault, either way i got a green light for re-uploading.

    As said last time:

    Here's a set of  2008/2009 Volvo 9700 buses.

    Bus liveries included.

    Nor-Way Bussekspres - Norway

    Timekspressen - Norway

    NSB Nettbuss - Norway

    All coaches are additonal, as i doubt you would want to replace any citybuses with this.

    **Remember, it's important that you run your game in hardware mode in order to make these buses work.**

    The textures are 512X512 pixels. Which is too much for the software mod, and the buses will look strange.

    Models: me
