  summary: Sightseeing buses automata + lots
  description: |-
    Here's some sightseeing buses i made as an experiment for just how much detail i could pump into an automata model, plus i've wanted these for my city centres for a very long time.

    The buses are as following.

    Two MAN buses, one with a yellow paintjob, and one based on some Berlin tour buses i saw.

    Two Leyland olympians, one right hand drive version, one left hand drive, it doesn't matter which you use, as these tourbuses often have left hand doors even in right hand drive countries.

    And last, a n Ikarus of sorts, with the roof cut off, and made open top, based heavily on such found in Budapest, Hungary.

    These buses function as taxis ingame, i know what you're thinking, why is a bsu there? Well the answer is very simple, they aren't part of the public bus network, in real life, so why should they be in SimCity 4 too? This way as taxis they will often pop around where you want them to drive, around your cities' landmarks.

    Models were made by me, as were textures, modding and lights for the night mode were made by Rivit. Big kudos to him!

    The lots included are just standard lots.
