    This building is a near accurate recreation of a new apartment building

    under construction in Haugesund,Norway .So far all the uppers floors are up and ready

    but the first floor is barely even started, [here's a picture of it under construction](http://i80.photobucket.com/albums/j179/Glenni91/DSC00322.jpg).

    Now, i know you are probably going to complain about the textures beeing to clean or whatever,

    this is supposed to look like it's brand new, so of course i made the textures rather clean,compared

    to the buildings ive made before that were always dirty looking and miserable.
