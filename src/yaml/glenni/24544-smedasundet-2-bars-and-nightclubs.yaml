  summary: Smedasundet 2 bars and nightclubs
  description: |-
    Heavily based on a building in the waterfront district in my hometown, Haugesund, Norway, which is the primary nightime entertainment area here.

    I don't know much about this building to be honest,  it was probably built in the early 1900's or late 1800's.

    Included in this download are two nightclubs, and one old fashioned bar

    Berserk (nightclub)  (This one is the one closest to the real building)

    The Glory (Gay Nightclub done by request)

    Dampen, an old fashioned bar.
