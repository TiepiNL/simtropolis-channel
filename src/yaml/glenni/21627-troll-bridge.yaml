  description: |-
    Hehe, fitting name for an old stone bridge i guess, here's a bridge model i made in just a few days, it overhangs over the lot, and crosses a 2 tile long gap, be aware that it WILL take some precission and time to place this correctly.

    Dependancies:

    You will need this for the gravel path approaching the bridge.
