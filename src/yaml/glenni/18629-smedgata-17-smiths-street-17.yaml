    Quite a colourful little thing isn't it? =P I was just looking for something different for the drab CS$ ones, though it still had to look grungy, so i made this, windows have a kinda weird design too, instead of going inwards, they stick outewards.It also got 3 family props for the clutter on the pavement, which means you get 3 different props each time you plop. Anyway, enjoy this little splash of randomness in your cities...

    And take a look at these pictures, why don't you... ![;)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaWink.gif)
