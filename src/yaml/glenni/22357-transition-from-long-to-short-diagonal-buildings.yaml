  summary: Transition from long to short diagonal buildings.
  description: |-
    ### **NOTE: No nightlights, i am having problems with lights appearing on my models after they have been exported  lately**.

    Here's a diagonal building i designed to act like a transition between the larger diagonal corner building made by prepo, in order to connect smaller diagonal buildings to the larger ones without leaving a gap or the buildings glitching into each other. i did do a very nicely done nightlighting, but well.. after i rendered they wouldn't appear in SimCity 4...

    I wish they would work, but they just won't...

    All the buildings are based on fairly well maintained buildings in Oslo, and this is also why the walls are this clean.

    landmark, nothing out of the ordinary, and that's about it
