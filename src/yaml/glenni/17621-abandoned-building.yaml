  summary: BLaM Abandoned Building
  description: |-
    Do you think the way buildings look when they abandon, is boring? No holes, boarded up windows or anything?

    Just a boring basic black/dark overlay?

    Well I thought so, and I made one abandoned one,with a fun Half-Life 2 theme! It's a pity a lot of the details got lost in the render though... Stupid BAT....

    Stats: Neutral, does neither have YIMBY or NIMBY effects, every mayor or city affecting effect at 0, but with a custom query.

    No point in making this a growable, because, first of all it has a huge hole in the back,and it is really crummy, not even low wealth sims would live in that hellhole...

    And yes it does have nightlights.
