  summary: Radisson BLU Oslo Plaza Version 2
  description: |-
    This is a remake of the old Radisson SAS Oslo Plaza model i released a few years ago.

    I cut a lot of the base, giving it a much more compact look ( not that i ever really liked Galleri Oslo which is a mall attached to this in real life), though it's still a quite large skyscraper footprint wise, as it is in real life. As the real one it has 37 floors, functions as a hotel for the Raddison BLU hotel chain. Upon completion and to this day it remains the tallest building in Oslo and Norway.

    It's still a GMAX BAT, so there's no fancy reflections like you'd get in 3dsmax, but i tried giving it a decent city reflection texture, without it being too noticeable, so that it may blend in in most settings.

    Stats:

    LM, functions like most landmarks, nothing much to say there, no jobs. 6x3 lot

    CS$$:

    Has 1700 occupants, if downgraded to CS$ it's 2000, stage 5 growable, sits on a 6x3 lot.

    Water consumed is 6.

    Power consumed is 6.
