  summary: Tunnelpack  ROAD version
  description: |-
    **(  Please don't request Avenue, One way, Highway, Real Highway or Network Widening Mod versions, i have the models, but i am doing this one step at a time, starting with roads! )**

    These are a pack of tunnel models acting like Subway stops, seeing as adding additional tunnel models in SC4 at the time is impossible.

    No nightlights though, i tried but couldn't get them to work in Max for whatever reason...

    There's 3 versions included:

    Yellow Lines

    White Lines

    Dashed Yellow Lines

    All models are HD rendered.

    Here's closeups of the models:
