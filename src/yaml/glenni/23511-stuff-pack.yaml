    Here's a few models i'm releasing in a bunch, it contains the following:

    They vary by quality and some are indeed without nightlights.

    Several towerblocks(highrises) of variosu design, some are really old models, others are new, but  lower in quality.

    Small 4 unit appartment buildings

    All of them function as landmarks without jobs.

    A library with 10000 capacity

    and last a Indoor Sports complex which functions as a hospital with a capacity of 21000 at max.
