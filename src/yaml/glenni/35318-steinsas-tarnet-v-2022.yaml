  summary: Steinsås Tårnet V 2022
  description: |-
    Once again, I redid a legacy BAT from my BLaM days.
    This is Steinsås Tårnet, or translated from Norwegian, Stone Ridge Tower a typical smaller midrise
    that curves nicely around a corner lot in your dense wall to wall environments!

    The original building was from 2006 - while the model itself looked solid enough, it did lack in a few areas.
    I redid the paraphet walls, adding more detail, making them a nice oxidised copper finnish.
    Completely redone nightlights, now the large visible interior spaces have omnis, not just nightmaps.
    All new glass textures, and I removed the modeled base for it, making it easier for anyone to relot.
    Redone interiors, more detail, more furniture.

    Textures are now lighter, and there's more detail in them.
    The roof was redone from a simple copy and paste of roof junk, to more purposeful, and realistic looking items.
    The bare rear and side walls of the tower have now been changed to be more mechanical looking, given that most of the tower won't
    be visible from street level. it now includes fans, ducts, pipes, aircondition units, cell phone equipment, etc.

    You can still keep the original if you wish, this new version will not override it. =)

    Install instructions:
    Place the files/folder into mydocuments/simcity4/plugins
    I recommend just simply placing the "Glenni" folder as it is in your plugins folder.
    That way you can easily organise my content.
    As these are GMAX renders, there is no Darknite version.

    There are extra images in the archive, no need to keep these if you don't wish to do so.

    Dependencies:

    None.
    Custom trees and parked cars visible in the screenshots are from override mods on existing maxis props in my game.
    without these, the props will just simply be default props within maxis prop families.

    Credits:

    Thank you to Tyberius06 for modding; making the growable lots, ploppable lots with jobs, and for starting the process of getting me
    to remaking this building to begin with. =)
