    **Avenue Roundabout Fillers**

    This package contains four avenue roundabout fillers for use in the middle of avenue roundabouts. Six lots are available to choose from.
    Note that you must plop the avenue roundabout first, demolish the middle four tiles then build the roundabout filler in the middle of the roundabout.

    **Pedestrian Underpass**
    Stinking and humid, this pedestrian underpass should have been closed down a long time ago, as this place is mostly just used as a hangout for hoodlums, criminals and bums.

    **Fountain**
    This fountain has huge oversized gold and silver coins at the bottom of the fountain. The fountain walls and bottom are all covered in beautiful mosaic patterns.

    **Generic**
    These are just your average roundabout pieces, nothing special about them, and can be used anywhere and everywhere from downtown areas to suburbs. There are 2 different versions. One with just a curb, grass and signs, and one with rails added.
