  summary: Generic Office Midrise - DIAGONAL
  description: |-
    Just a basic concrete building I made quickly, so don't expect any fantastic quality here. It has a logo for the human resource multinational corporation; Adecco on top, just randomly chosen, so it's not based on a real building.
    Either way as usual for diagonals the model overhangs, it can be a bit tricky to place, but with some practise you'll find it easy.

    Since I don't know how to do landmarks with jobs you'll just have to take the static landmark.
    Stats are just basic Landmark stats.

    **No dependencies** (well it has no props, now does it?)
