  summary: Falkeid Office Tower
  description: |-
    Now here's an old one, I've had the GMAX scene for
    this one sitting on my PC for far too long, and thus i decided to finish it.
    It's basically a simple 1970's concrete highrise. Good for urban or suburban office development.

    The Landmark lot holds a more open and widespread look to it, ideal for
    European suburbs. While the growable is fit for the more urban setting.

    Texturing's not the best on this one, since i decided to finish it rather quickly.

    Growable:

    Growth Stage: 3
    Density: High
    R$$$: 1500 inhabitants

    Landmark:
    Default stats, except it costs 0 a month. and it costs 5000 or around that.

    **Dependencies:**
