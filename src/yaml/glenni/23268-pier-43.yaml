    Inspired by the maxis lot Mrbisnom uploaded and, this is my contribution:

    This is Pier 43, inspired by many real life converted industrial and naval areas converted into shops, lofts and entertainment locales. The lot took me no less than 10 hours to make, with carefully planning each detail.

    The lot consists entirely of maxis props in an attempt to make something interesting and fresh with the standard maxis props, in my opinion i think this worked pretty well, i am not quite sure about yours though.

    Stats:

    Lotsize 5x18

    the rest is standard plugin manager park stats.
