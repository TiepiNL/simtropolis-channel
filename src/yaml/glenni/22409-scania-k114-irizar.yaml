  summary: Scania K114 Irizar
  description: |-
    Here's a Scania Irizar, it's a fairly common coach ( that's tour/travel buses for those who are unfamiliar with that word) in Europe.  The coachwork is done in the Basque region of Spain.

    I made textures for three versions, two of them are fit for Left hand Roads, while one is right hand.

    Bus Eireann (ireland) (Left hand)

    National Express (United Kingdom) (Left hand)

    Nor-Way Bussekspress (Norway) (Right hand)

    I'm afraid i won't do further reskin resquests, but if you want you may ask Simfanatik for a reaskin.

    Wether or not he wants to do it is entirely his decision though, so don't overload him with work.

    Please also note that in order for the 512X512 textures to appear, the game msut be in hardware mode.

    As earlier this model including textures was made by me

    Modding, lightning and anything else was done by Simfanatik.
