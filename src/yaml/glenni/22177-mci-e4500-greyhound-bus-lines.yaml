  summary: MCI E4500 Greyhound Bus Lines
  description: |-
    Another bus from me, they just keep coming, don't they?![:P](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaTounge.gif)

    This time it's based on an MCI E4500 in Greyhound US and Greyhound Canada liveries. I did try my best to make it resmble the E4500, but i didn't get it quite right, the back for instance is a slight bit different, but it's not that big of a deal i think. This also has nightlights but not as much as a citybus, as this is indeed a coach, and therefore it can't have lights on all the time.

    This comes as additional only, as i don't think anyone would want to make this replace a citybus.

    Model is yet again made by me, Simfanatik did the modding as last time, aswell as the light models.

    Enjoy, and don't get killed by a psychopath on the trip!
