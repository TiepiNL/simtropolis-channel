  summary: Breidablikk Skole V2022
  description: |-
    Another old BLaM release I wanted to touch up on.
    Based on a real school building in my hometown - Haugesund, Norway. Using the same name.
    I wasn't quite happy with the old model, the windows were too dark, I made the wall textures a little too plain, etc.
    One of the main issues were that the dark windows blended into the red window frames, making the entire window look burgundy.
    Ew.
    it was also infamous for having an immortal building bug, meaning it couldn't be demolished properly, even if you tried. ![o.O](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/default_47.gif "o.O")

    The game screams for more urban schools.
    So here's my second attempt, more details, and more of an effort to make it fit with the Maxis buildings.
    Even with the graininess everything from maxis tends to have. ![:P](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaTounge.gif ":P")

    Tyberius06 for modding. I just don't feel confident with putting stuff in the game, and possibly breaking it (after all, that happened last time)
    So it helps to have people that don't mind helping. ^^
