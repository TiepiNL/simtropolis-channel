    Hopefully fixed the files now, sorry i included the wrong file. Entirely my fault.

    One of my 'lil side projects...

    Based on the Ulvøy Bridge (Ulvøybrua) in Oslo, Norway.

    I transit enabled one of the ends, and let the rest overhang, **it's not functional and is purely for decorational purposes only**. It's not very large, shouldn't be any longer than 12-14 tiles.
