  summary: Nuclear Starbucks 2K10 Edition functional waterpump + Roundabout centerpiece.
  description: |-
    As requested. Your wish is my command, this version functions as a water tower, and comes in two versions, standard plaza version, and a roundabout centrepiece.

    Art with function, what more could you want?

    Stats:

    Chugs out 50 000 liters a year.

    costs 300 a month.

    Costs 600 to bulldoze.

    600 to plop.
