  summary: Overhanging road texture models on 2x1 lots
  description: |-
    **( Please look at the bigger images before rating!And if you don't like the idea/ lots please don't flame...)**
    These are 2x1 lots, with overhanging models hanging over ONE tile in each END.
    They were inspired by j-dub's set. There are 4 different models.
    Euro/ One way worn
    Yellow stripes worn
    Euro/ One way very worn down
    Cobblestone road

    Stats:

    All standard plugin manager stats, xcept for the capacity,
    these work as bus stops, and i made the capacity to 1000 000.
    In order to not clog your roads up completely.
    How-to-do:

    Each lot is a 2x1 lot, you place them TWO tiles AWAY from each one.
    And drag your road /one way road through it.
    Don't put them one tile away from each other, that can cause some visual glitches.

    These were only made to match the [euro asphalt mod](https://www.simtropolis.com/stex/index.cfm?id=17351), linked to here, if you want this to match your
    existing sidewalk texture mod, you'll need to re-lot them by yourself.

    Don't do this;

    1:
    Don't put them on hills, it will end up looking weird and buggy.

    1:
    Don't put them 1 tile away from each other, each lot need to be 2 tiles away from each other.

    Some side affects:
    According to Jplumbley this old and outdated method can cause some mess ups in the pathing.
    So be aware of that,don't put it dense areas.

    Some bugs:
    The cobblestone texture can sometimes get weird errors if placed near buildings,
    Not all of them match 100% with the road surface, i needed to raise some of the models,
    in order to not get ugly diagonal lines on the models, you decide what's worst, not matching 100% with the network,
    or hideous jagged lines all over the model.
    you decide what's worst...
