  summary: Hideous halfway abandoned concrete slab thing
  description: |-
    As the name says, this is pretty much a very decayed building, with visually only a few tenants left ( though with 60 jobs to keep it more or less with the game building size > number of jobs logic in order to avoid it popping up everywhere if say it had 4 jobs)

    Not much to say else, except it's an old bat with some redone textures, formerly made for my communistic country CJ which went inactive.
    The ground floor is occupied by a poorly maintained supermarket.

    Stats:
    Commercial Service $
    Medium density
    Occupants: 60
    Stage 3:
    Water: 4
    Power:2

    Landmark:
    Pretty standard, low price

    **Dependencies:** none

    Enjoy
