  summary: Japanese Hakuto Shrine
  description: |-
    Here's a shrine inspired by some pictures and ideas Moshi here on ST gave me. i tried best as i could to recreate a japanese Hakuto shrine based on one particular shrine. Not sure where in Japan it was. or what it's name was.

    This also comes with a tori gate, stone lamps, a stone walkway, a gravel/dirt patch and some wish walls.

    From what Moshi told me people hang up wishcards for their friends, relatives or loved ones during holidays.

    By the way,for those who don't know, i am not Japanese, and i can not understand japanese. so please if you comment, write in English.
