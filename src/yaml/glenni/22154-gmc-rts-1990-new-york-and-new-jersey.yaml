  summary: GMC RTS 1990 New York and New Jersey
  description: |-
    This is the GMC RTS, one of the most common buses across North America, the buses operate in many cities and states, these particular buses i made are based on MTA (New York City transit) and

    NJ Transit ( New jersey Transit).

    I don't plan on doing any reskins to this, but if you want to make one, feel free to do so. Just give me credit.

    Now, these buses would never work without the help of Simfanatik. I made the models, but the modding,

    lightning and simply the functionality of these were made possible by Simfanatik, big kudos to him!

    Important:

    Bus 1 is (MTA) New york

    Bus 2 is (Nj Transit) New jersey

    Both files come as additionals. and replacements.

    Remember that you can only have one replacement file, if you install both the only one bus will appear, in addition it might appear rather screwy.

    Keep your eyes peeled for more buses coming from me and Simfanatik in the future.
