    **Reworked February 2018: Please demolish existing versions in your city, and delete your old version from your plugins folder.**

    The Transit enabling switches were also updated.

    This is a quickie, basically modeled in just a few minutes, a recreation of the remaining concrete bus sheds from my city Haugesund, Norway in the 70's.

    I've  always sort of liked these, so I wanted to put them in the game. ![;)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaWink.gif ";)")
