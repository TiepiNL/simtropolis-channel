  summary: Glenni's House
  description: |-
    A copy of my house here in Haugesund, Norway. The proper recreation is the one which is slightly offwhite. I have made some colour variations and the lot uses a family so each time it builds it has a chance of being one of 5 colours. I tried to make the colours not stand out as much as the last set, but i couldn't completely de-saturate it either. Besides, houses here can actually get such bright paint colours...

    Here's all 5 in action.
