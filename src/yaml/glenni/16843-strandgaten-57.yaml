    The buidling exists in my hometown Haugesund,Norway ,

    it is the first recreation of a recreation project i am working on,

    recreating some of the buildings in my hometown .

    The style might be a bit different to what you are normally used to, as

    they are built in wood , most old buildings of my hometown are

    in coastal towns and cities in Norway.

    A little information about the taggings on the walls:

    "Poo" is not something i wrote just to be plain immature,

    but in the mid 90's some punks tagged "poo" all over the town

    "Olga Crew" is apparantly some crew who tags

    their name all over the town lately.
