    Please big at bigger images provdided **BEFORE** rating! :

    Here's a new set from me, this time it has road,one way road,street and one the for european road mod

    Stats:All the same as a any subway station,except capacity is 60000.

    All lots are also transit enabled,and they connect to the subway network.

    The cars don't show because  i neither know the coding and LODding needed...

    Bigger pictures:
