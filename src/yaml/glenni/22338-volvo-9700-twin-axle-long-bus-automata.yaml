  summary: Volvo 9700 twin axle long bus Automata
  description: |-
    Here's a set of  2008/2009 Volvo 9700 buses, in this case it is a twin axle bus. The shorter buses will come later on.

    Bus liveries included.

    EurOlines - Europe in Generel

    Student Agency - Luxury coachliner in Czech Republic

    Nor-Way Bussekspres - Norway

    All coaches are additonal, as i doubt you would want to replace any citybuses with this.

    Remember, it's important that you run your game in hardware mode in order to make these buses work.

    The textures are 512X512 pixels. Which is too much for the software mod, and the buses will look strange.

    Models: me

    modding nightlighting and any final changes: Simfanatik.
