  summary: ITS Birmingham Rotunda diag/ortho relot
  description: |-
    This is what happens when i am bored; look at other people's buildings on the STEX, and get ideas in my head.

    This is Ill Tonkso's Birmingham Rotunda. A skyscraper that on the original sits on a normal lot. By experimenting a little, I found out that it could also be used for diagonal purposes. And thus you have my results here.

    I made this for my own useage, but since i thought it would be handy for others i figured i might as well release this.
