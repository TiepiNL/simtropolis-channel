  summary: Haugesund seaside warehouse pack
  description: |-
    This pack is a recreation of the old type of wooden warehouses or packhouses, as some call them. These were built in the coastal communities of Norway.  for instance, my hometown,  Haugesund, these kind of buildings are even found in the major cities of Norway, like: Bergen , Trondheim and Stavanger.
    They were mostly constructed for storing, salting, and preparing fish for transport. Though they also had their purpose as warehouses for storing wood and barrels of fish, some also made their own barrels at the site.
