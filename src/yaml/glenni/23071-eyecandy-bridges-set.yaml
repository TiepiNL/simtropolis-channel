  summary: Eyecandy bridges set
  description: |-
    Here's a little set of non functional bridges ive been working on, the following are:
    An old metal suspension bridge
    An ancient stone bridge
    An old arched stonebridge
    and a North American type covered bridge in wood.

    And that's not all, i also included some diagonal oriented ones of 4 of the models.

    There are some visual glitches due to the LODs  ( i tried as best as i could...) , but as long as you cover them up cleverly with either flora, or other items they should look fine, this mostly applies to the approaches.
    Either way i hope you can find some usage for these.
