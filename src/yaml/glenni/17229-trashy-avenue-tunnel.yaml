    I just made this for fun, for my own city but decided to release this, it is a little bit less cleaner

    looking tunnel for those of you wanting a tunnel for ghetto areas.

    Stats: Basicaly the same as any subway station except capacity is at 60000 for a smooth traffic slow.

    The lot is transit enabled.

    Cars are not visible driving through the tunnel...

    it would be cool but that would require some very complex LODding, maybe if swamper helped

    me i could maybe release another one

    Thanks to Xdesign for the basic model.
