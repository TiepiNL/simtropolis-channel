  summary: Nuclear Starbucks 2K10 edition - The SRS NRML VRSN
  description: |-
    **NOTE: a second version may appear, i uploaded this  1am in the morning my time, and it still has yet to appear, i have been given a Go-Ahead by the Mods.**

    This is basically the non-radical lot and model, this time it's modern sculpture, with a gold looking reflective metal plating (or it could be gold if you feel the need to be all bling, your imagination i guess). People have expressed they liked the actual model and would like to see a normal on that wouldn't drain your  cities' power and water, and poison it. So, without further ado, there's the normal one for all your modern sculpture needs!

    i suppose it's obvious, but it has no nightlights. I don't quite understand the BAT4max nightlight export to be honest.

    Stats:

    Nothing worth listing, it's a park, it acts like a park, dogs poop in it and scary men hide in the bushes.

    Dependencies:

    None
