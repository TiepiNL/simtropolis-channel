  summary: Sorhauggaten 129 Haugesund
  description: |-
    Sorhauggaten 129 (Sørhauggaten 129) is a recreated building from the centre of my hometown Haugesund, it was built in 1907.
    As well as recreating it as it is. With White paint on the wooden walls, and black paint on the trims and frames,
    i also made four other colour variations Blue,green,red and yellow.
    The building sits on a 2x1 lot (1 tile wide, 2 tiles deep) and each time it grows, it gets a different model.

    Here's two extra images:
