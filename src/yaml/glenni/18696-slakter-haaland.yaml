  summary: Slakter Haaland
  description: |-
    Haaland's Butcher Shop is situated in the pedestrian street Haraldsgaten in my hometown, Haugesund, Norway. It was originally built in 1889, but the old one burnt down, so this current one is just from 1998. It's a pretty close reconstruction of the old one, minus that it has one extra floor.
    It's got a good reputation in my town for selling very high quality meat, and Finn Haaland did always greet with you with a smile, alwaus service minded, and gave free pancakes for the kids(and those pancakes were gooooood!!!!!). That's is sadly over now, as he just recently  passed away...
