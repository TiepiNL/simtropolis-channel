  summary: Ulveskar Bridge
  description: |-
    Something i just came up with, because i needed a small bridge for my Cj which i have yet to update. The design was slightly based of the famous Golden gate Bridge stylewise.

    It's just 1 lane, so of course it would be rather tricky to get it to actually work.

    Stats:

    Size: 1x1

    Wealth Medium/§§

    Bulldoze Cost: 211

    Plop Cost: 5900

    item Order: 1

    Flammability: 10

    MaxFireStage: 1

    Power Consumed: 32

    Water Consumed: 0

    Place the file into mydocuments/simcity4/plugins It's advised to make a folder for my stuff within plugins,

    in order to organise it.

    dependencies:

    none

    Enjoy.
