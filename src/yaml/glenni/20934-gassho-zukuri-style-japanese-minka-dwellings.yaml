#   summary: Gassho Zukuri Style Japanese Minka Dwellings
#   description: |-
#     **Gassho-zukuri** houses are a type of Japanese housing particular to the historic villages of Shirakawa-g? and Gokayama in Toyama and Gifu Prefecture, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This Gassho-zukuri, or "prayer-hands construction" style is characterized by a thatched and steeply slanting roof resembling two hands joined in prayer.

#     The design is exceptionally strong and, in combination with the unique properties of the thatching, allows the houses to withstand and shed the weight of the region's heavy snowfalls in winter. The houses are large, with three to four stories encompassed between the low eaves, and intended, historically, to house large extended families and a highly-efficient space for a variety of industries.

#     The densely-forested mountains of the region still occupy 96% of all land in the area, and prior to the introduction of heavy earth-moving machinery; the narrow bands of flat lands running the length of the river valley limited the area available for agriculture and homestead development.

#     The upper stories of the Gassho houses were usually set aside for sericulture, or silk production, while the areas below the first floor were often used for the production of nitre, one of the raw materials needed for the production of gunpowder. Many of the houses are still used as housing, although some have been converted into shops, diners, and inns, due to the many tourists visiting the villages after their designation as a World Heritage Site and the completion of a highway linking the mountainous region to the third largest metropolitan area in Japan, Nagoya in 2008.

#     **BAT information:**

#     Comes with a slightly rotated, normal, and snow covered version. As well as a nice little shed.  there are also two variations for the houses( does not include the snow covered version).

#     Not an NDEX release, despite some of the descs having NDEX in the title. Small mistake there.
