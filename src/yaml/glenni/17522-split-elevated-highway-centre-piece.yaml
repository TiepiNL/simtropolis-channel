  summary: Split Elevated Highway Centre piece
  description: |-
    First ,read [this](https://www.simtropolis.com/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=23&threadid=85006&enterthread=y)

    before  asking questions,this is a rather simple model actually

    it's just a flat 1x1 piece with props on,and some texture detail,but i guess it does it's job, the 4 varied lots can be found in the park menu

    dependencies: none

    Stats:

    Just a normal park lot,default stats.

    Enjoy!
