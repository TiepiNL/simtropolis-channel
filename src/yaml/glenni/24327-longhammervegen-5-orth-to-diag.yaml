  description: |-
    Another wall to wall building for you guys. This time featuring 'exquisite' services such as d√∂ner kebabs and used appliances! What more could you want? Comes in two directions.

    Extra: OWR 1 version, no buildings to fit for it yet though. Only limited use for the time being.

    Stats: normal landmark costs 50 a month.

    Deps: none
