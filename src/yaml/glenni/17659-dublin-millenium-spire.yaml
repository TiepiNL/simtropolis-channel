  summary: Dublin Millenium Spire
  description: |-
    The Spire of Dublin (also known as the Monument of Light) is a large, pin-like monument built in 2003,

    120 metres (393 ft) in height. It is located on the site of the former

    Nelson Pillar on O'Connell Street in the Irish capital, Dublin.

    My version is 480 metre, as height

    in SimCity 4 is multiplied 4 times.

    Other names and nicknames:

    \* The Spike

    \* The Spire in the Mire (a reflection on O'Connell Street's unsavoury reputation)

    \* The Stiletto in the Ghetto (O'Connell St is a very short distance from some of Dublin's poorest and most drug-ruined communities).

    \* The Nail in the Pale

    \* The Stiffy by the Liffey (a reference to Dublin's principal waterway, the River Liffey)

    \* The Pin in the Bin (a reference to the perceived amount of litter in O'Connell Street)

    \* The erection at the intersection

    \* Pointless

    \* The Stick
