  summary: Norwegian House Set 2 Remade
  description: |-
    This is a retexture and slight rescale of my old Norwegian House Set 2, released back in 2006 under the BLaM team label.
    While I wanted them to be colourful then, they turned out a bit too saturated for the game. This time around they should look better. ![:)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaSmile.gif ":)")

    The houses are based on typical mass produced houses you'd find in Norway (Probably Sweden too) during the 1990s and 2000s.
    They come in a range of colours, 14 in total. The default is a primary colour, with white frames.
    Other variants have a base colour with a different colour on the window frames, etc.

    The colours are:
    All white
    Red
    Yellow
    Green
    Blue
    Orange
    Olive green
    Purple
    Pink,
    Brown with green frames
    White with red frames
    White with blue frames
    Yellow with green frames
    Dark Grey with Dark Grey frames.

    There are two types included, R$$ and R$

    \- We chose to include these, since the game needs more R$ that doesn't look
    decayed or overly poor. Just like real life, families with lower income can also afford these.
    They live comfortably, but usually with somewhat simpler landscaping outside the house.

    Stats:

    \- 3 R$$ lots: 1x2 (stage 4), 1x3 (stage 3), 2x1 (stage 4) - 18 residents
    \- 3 R$ lots: 1x2 (stage 4), 1x3 (stage 3), 2x1 (stage 3) - 30 residents

    All grow within the Euro tileset.

    R$$: Consumes 2 units of power/water

    R$: Consumes 1 units of power/water

    R$: 1 air, 1 water, 4 garbage, 0 radiation

    R$$: 1 air, 1 water, 4 garbage, 0 radiation

    Install instructions:
    Place the files/folder into mydocuments/simcity4/plugins
    I recommend just simply placing the "Glenni" folder as it is in your plugins folder.
    That way you can easily organise my content.
    As these are GMAX renders, there is no Darknite version.

    There are extra images in the archive, no need to keep these if you don't wish to do so.

    Dependencies:

    None.
    Custom trees and parked cars visible in the screenshots are from override mods on existing maxis props in my game.
    without these, the props will just simply be default props within maxis prop families.

    Credits:

    Thank you to Tyberius06 for modding, and combining models and desc in family prop IDs, and building family IDs.

    I hope you enjoy these, I also have newer projects on the way, see my BAT thread for more info:
