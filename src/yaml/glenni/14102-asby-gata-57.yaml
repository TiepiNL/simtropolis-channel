    I made this buidling before my pc ccrashed because of a virus.I got it rendered ,but i do NOT have the 3d model.(sorry i can't make any changes).It was supposed to fit on a 1x2 lot but the LODs was a bit to big compared to the building so i made the lot 2x3 now to make it to not look so bad ,I placed some default buildings between it so it looks like it is wall to wall after all.  The name was from a local street here in Haugesund,Norway ,but the building does not exist there in real life.

    Barbyw made it a growable C$$

    Jobs: i don't know how many jobs it is .She never told me.

    PS.i can't guarantee it will grow but i included a prop so you can place the prop on a lot you have made yourself though.

    I understand if you rate this low ,but please don't just start flaming me.
