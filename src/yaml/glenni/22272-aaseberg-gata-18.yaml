  summary: Aaseberg Gata 18 large  Diagonal corner and orthogonal
  description: |-
    Here's something that has been lying on my pc since 2007, it's basically a large corner diagonal building, it doesn't fit into any corner like small corner buildings though, so that may pose a problem for where you want to place it.

    Modding is pretty simple, i don't have time nor the patience to test or modd my BATs to perfection.

    Also, for some odd reason there was no lights appearinjg at night on the diagonal version, not sure what caused that, and i won't fix it.

    Budget cost: 130

    Bulldoze cost:  23

    Flammability: 5

    Plop cost: 600

    Power: 40
