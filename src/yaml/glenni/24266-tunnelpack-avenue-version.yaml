  summary: Tunnelpack AVENUE version
  description: |-
    **(  Please don't request One way, Highway, Real Highway or  Network Widening Mod versions, i have the models, but i am doing this one step at a time, starting with roads! )**

    These are a pack of tunnel models acting like Subway stops, seeing as adding additional tunnel models in SC4 at the time is impossible.

    No nightlights though, i tried but couldn't get them to work in Max for whatever reason...

    These are for avenue, remember that.

    All models are HD rendered.
