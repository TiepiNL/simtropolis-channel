  summary: LAMBDA Arts college
  description: |-
    Here's an old model i made in 2006, which i decided to finish now.

    I lost most of the textures that was already on it, so i decided to texture it with slightly better textures than the what ir originally had.

    Anyway...

    It's name is LAMBDA, and it's now an arts college (not possible in SC4, so it functions as a normal college)
    it was originally supposed to be a residential/office, but well.. i though it would be a bit too unique looking for being RCI.

    Capacity is 2000, otherwise all stats are default SC4 Plugin manager.
