  summary: Temporary Building Units
  description: |-
    These are small units roughly the size of a regular shipping container in real life, they can be standalone, or put together to form a building albeit weak, these are often seen on construction sites as housing set up for the workers, as well as lunch rooms, offices etc. I thought this was something several missing from Sc4, so i made these.

    All thoguh quickly, i needed something like this for my cities, so i made them pretty quick, so don't expect no fantastic quality here =P

    They come on several different versions:

    Red

    Yellow

    and Grey

    There's also three different versions to determine for which floors they are supposed to be.

    The bottom one has doors on either side, the middle one has plywood sheets where the door would normally be, and finaly the top section has a little roof junk.

    They sit on a standard Landmark lot, no jobs.
