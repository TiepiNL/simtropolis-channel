  summary: Roundabout Centre pieces
  description: |-
    No point in uploading this as BLAM as it is to simple. Anyway here are two roundabout center pieces

    A generic looking one with a flowerbed in it,and a art sculpture.

    The textures are crappy because i made these a LONG time ago...

    Stats: the same as the default parks.
