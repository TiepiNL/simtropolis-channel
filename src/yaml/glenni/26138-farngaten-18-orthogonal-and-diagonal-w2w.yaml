  summary: Farngaten 18 Orthogonal and Diagonal W2W
  description: |-
    Yes, I'm still around, you haven't gotten rid of me quite yet! ^.^

    This is Farngaten 18, a building i made based on a building in Urtegata, Oslo. i chose this one as i thought the iron detailing and spire would be a nice addition to w2w cities.

    It comes as a Landmark without jobs in either normal or diagonal version, and as a Growable R$$ at medium density.

    Stats:

    Landmark:

    Mostly standard stuff

    2x1 normal lot

    1x1 lot where the model overhangs

    Growable:

    Grows in Euro and Chicago tileset.

    Medium Density,

    Stage 5.

    110 occupants, 130 when downgraded to R$

    Dependencies:

    [NDEX Mega Props Vol 1](https://www.simtropolis.com/forum/files/file/19096-ndex-glenni-mega-props-vol01/)

    Install it to mydocuments\\SimCity 4\\plugins using either WinRAR or any other .ZIP programs.

    Enjoy! ![^_^](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/default_5.gif)
