    # 6459978.'s Small Bungalows

    Made to resemble the WWII era bungalows in my Toronto neighbourhood, here is a set of 7 new growable bungalows. They are made to grow in an existing building family, thus adding diversity to your developing neighbourhoods. Enjoy!

    ## Stats:  
    \-growable  
    \-R$$  
    \-each houses 11 sims

    Included in folder are 16 files, comprising of:

    8 SC4Model files:  
     7 Bungalow models  
     1 custom foundation model

    8 SC4Desc files:  
     7 Bungalow descriptions  
     1 custom foundation description

    The 7 models are as follows:  
     1 - green roof, red bricks  
     2 - blue roof, yellow bricks  
     3 - black roof, grey bricks  
     4 - black roof, brown bricks  
     5 - green roof, blue bricks  
     6 - red roof, orange bricks  
     7 - brown roof, pink bricks

    There are no lot files associated with these buildings, since I have added them to the building family R$$ 10x12; i.e., these will grow automatically on the same sorts of lots as the original buildings of the game did.
