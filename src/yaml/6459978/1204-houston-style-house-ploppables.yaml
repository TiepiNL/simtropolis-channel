  summary: Houston style house ploppables
  description: |-
    The last of the middle class neighbourhood ploppables! With all three, you should be able to truly create different neighbourhoods in your city (since this feature is a little weak in the game itself!)

    These 5 ploppables use custom prop groups and will randomly select from the different houston houses to plop. While it claims they're Houston "ultramodern," they remind be of stuff built in Toronto in the 70s, and even of some pre war stuff! But, I'm sure everyone will appreciate these in his or her own way!

    Just unzip into plugins, and "yes to all" the overwriting.
