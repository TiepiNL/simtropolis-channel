  summary: Crumby Arms
  description: |-
    Perhaps I revel in the mundane, but lately I have become very interested in the low wealth type apartment building that there are so many of in my neighbourhood. So, using all the little details I've noticed, I created "Crumby Arms," which I think is pretty representative of the style.

    I've taken extreme care to get all the details right; for example, the windows are always directly below the floor slab on these buildings (I have never seen an exception to this.) Also, I've mimicked real buildings in the 3 sectioned windows, the recessed balconies and the antennas on the roof. Please rate accordingly.
