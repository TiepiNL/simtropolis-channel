    # Simcoe Place

    ### by 6459978.  

    A minutely detailed recreation of the 30 story office tower in Toronto, Canada. Everything from the roof junk to the truck loading bay is recreated here faithfully. BAT features include realistic, full interior nightlighting, as well as transparency mapped windows. The lot comes in both growable and ploppable forms, with stats that complement the game's original buildings.

    This lot has been a long time in the making, and I owe credit to some dedicated "behind the scenes" contributors. In no particular order: many thanks to **T Wrecks** who created and tweaked all the lots for this BAT, as well as providing a superb custom menu icon and readme, and thanks also to the "super-renderers" **SC4 meister** and **Pooty** for their persistence in producing a great final product.

    ## Dependencies:

    None at all!

    ## Package Info:

    The zip file contains everything you'll need, and a few things you *shouldn't* copy into your plugins folder. Only copy the SC4model file located directly in the zip and one (or more) of the contained lot files. Do *not* copy the screenshots or the readme into your plugins folder as this could degrade the game's performance.

    The included lots are:

    CO$$ Growable  
    CO$$ Ploppable  
    CO$$$ Growable  
    CO$$$ Ploppable  
    Landmark  
      
    More than one of these lots *can* be used at the same time.
