    *The ultimate in R$ realism*

    This BAT is a tribute to the little details that set apart mediocre work from Maxis calibre.

    When it comes to texturing and modelling, no detail was spared. All textures are custom made and there is no visible tiling. Each balcony of the complex is a treasure trove of detail, decked out with air conditioning units, laundry hung out to dry, tables and chairs, barbeques, the list goes on...

    In order to ensure that this realism transcends daytime and carries into the night, the traditional Maxis niteliting was done away with; instead I have endured the pains of using interior lighting, meaning that some windows glow brightly with a yellow tinge while others reflect the dim blue iridescence of a TV screen. This also allows the interior geometry to show through.

    The style of this BAT reflects the 60s-70s style of construction in Toronto. There are two colour schemes of the model included; a red brick and a yellow brick version.

    Many thanks to T Wrecks for Modding the statistics of this BAT to a sensible level.

    In my humble opinion, this BAT fulfills the task of merging seamlessly with the existing SC4 palette, while adding new opportunities to the game. But you don't have to take my word for it,  ![;)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaWink.gif)  download away!
