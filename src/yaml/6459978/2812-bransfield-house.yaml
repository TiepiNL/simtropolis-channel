  summary: Bransfield House
  description: |-
    Second in my line of realistic low-wealth housing is "Bransfield House," a mammoth structure that is a replica of a building in Toronto.

    This set contains 2 lots, a 3x8 and a 7x8 version. Both are ploppable (since they are too large to grow) and function as R$.

    Each lot houses 2000 R$ sims, and is priced at a $15000 plop cost.

    All required plugins are included in the zip, including 3 custom props.

    Much time and effort was put into making this building as realistic as possible. Please rate accordingly.
