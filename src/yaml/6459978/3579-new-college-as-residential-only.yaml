  summary: New College as Residential Only
  description: |-
    To say that this BAT is a direct copy of New College at the University of Toronto would be a lie; this building is fashioned from my own imagination. The general form, however is based on New College (i.e. brick walls, that funny curvy part, two interlocking structures...)

    I've uploaded this as a stage 5 R$ building. Though the real New College is a university owned residence, it also looks good as a low wealth housing block. Great care has been put into texturing this model; I created custom weathered textures for the walls and roof and a whole slew of window textures.

    This includes a 4 x 3 growable stage 5 residential lot based on a medium-sized apartment block with a rounded L-shaped floor plan. The lot serves as a dwellings for poor Sims (R$) and grows in the architectural styles of Chicago, New York, Houston and Euro.

    Occupancy: 866

    Bulldoze Cost: 568

    Let me know what you think.
