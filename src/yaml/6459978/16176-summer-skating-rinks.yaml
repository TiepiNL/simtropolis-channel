    **Summer Skating Rinks  
      
    **This was requested by TheJerseyDevil73 for his amazing Edmonton recreation. It's two simple models of skating rinks as they might be seen in the summer (with no ice) so as to better blend in with the rest of SimCity's summery weather. There are two models: grass and concrete.   
      
    **PLEASE NOTE: *This is not a* *lot! This is a bare-bones BAT, containing only the SC4model files. To place these on a lot you must use the Plugin Manager and the Lot Editor.*** (If someone wishes to do so and re-upload a lot to the STEX, feel free. No need to ask permission, just credit me for the models.)  
      
    Just to be absolutely clear, the zip contains two SC4model files: "Skating Rink" and "Skating Rink Grass"
