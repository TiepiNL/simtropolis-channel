    # Roy Thomson Hall

    **by 6459978.**

    Here it is: the long awaited, minutely detailed recreation of one of Toronto's most unique landmarks! Roy Thomson Hall was designed by Arthur Erickson and Mather and Haldenby, and opened in 1982 at the intersection of King and Simcoe in downtown Toronto. Over the years it has hosted everyone from the Tragically Hip to Queen Elizabeth II, in addition to being the home of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra.  
      
    This lot comes in two versions: a landmark lot, and a conditional reward lot. Only one version should be used at once.  
      
    This project has been a long time in the making and I must give credit to those who deserve it. In no particular order, thanks to **T Wrecks** for the stat tweaking and custom icon, **Ardecila** for the reward scripting, and **mikeseith** for use of his excellent car models.  
      
      
    **Dependencies:**  
      
    None at all!  
      
      
    **Package Info:**  
      
    The zip file contains everything you'll need to get Roy Thomson Hall into your game. Simply copy the model file and *one* of the lot files into your plugins folder. (Copying *both* lot files could cause a minor conflict.) Also, do *not* copy the readme into your plugins folder as it could degrade game performance.
