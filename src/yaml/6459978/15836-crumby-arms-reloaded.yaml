    ## Introduction / Overview

    An old classic is coming back to the STEX - and this time, it is better than ever. Crumby Arms has been totally remade based on exactly the same design and dimensions, but with improved modeling, considerably improved textures and, most of all, with working night lights!

    In this archive, you will find 4 lots in total, all of them low-wealth residential (R$) growables:  
    \- two 3x3, stage 6, medium-density lots with a single building each,  
    \- one 3x2, stage 7, high-density lot with a single building, and  
    \- one 3x4, stage 7, high-density lot with two buildings.

    The lots with a single building house 568 poor souls, the one with two buildings 1,136. All lots will grow in New York, Houston and Euro tilesets.

    You can use as many lots as you want, and you can use this new version together with the old one. The old buildings will not be replaced or overwritten; this is an entirely new file.

    ## Dependencies

    None!

    ## Installation

    Just unzip the entire content of this ZIP into some archive folder. Keep all building versions, readme, and screenshots, and maybe even back it up onto a CD or an external HD together with your other SC4 stuff. This way, if you need to clean your HD and reinstall your OS, you can simply copy the stuff from your backup archive into your plugins folder again instead of having to download all plugins anew.  
    Now go to your regular plugins folder and make a sub-folder for this download, or use the existing folder created by the installer of the original version.  
    Then, simply copy the the sub-folder(s) of whatever version(s) you'd like to use into that folder.  
    Remember that you can delete any undesired lot file from the sub-folders included in this download. The files are named in a way that will make it easy to see which one is which.

    Make sure that you don't delete the "Crumby Arms 2 Essentials" folder, or you will get brown boxes! (Well, essentially, Crumby Arms *is* a brown box, but you know what I mean... =P )

    To uninstall a version you don't like *after the building has already appeard in game*, first bulldoze all instances of that version in your cities, then save the cities and exit. Now you can safely remove the version without running any risk to experience crashes or any other inconvenience.
