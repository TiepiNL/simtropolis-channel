    Thanks for the comments on my last BAT!

    This is the first the series (hopefully). I'll be making modernish buildings located in "Chacarilla", because, as you may have noticed, there aren't a lot of medium sized buildings. This is my 2nd BAT ![1.gif](https://www.simtropolis.com/fckEditor/editor/../../forum/i/expressions/1.gif).

    This BAT was based on a w2w building in "Precursores", Lima. Hopefully I'll make more of these.

    I'll post an in-game pic asap.

    Night-lightning: Yes (**Note**: For some reason, nightlightning doesn't work in my game even though I've updated it. It should work for you. I've posted gmax pic)

    Lot size: 1x2

    Wealth: R$$

    Stage: 6

    Density: medium

    **Dependencies: None!**

    Thanks
