  summary: R$$ Mini Pack Santiaguino
  description: |-
    **Brief Introduction**

    This mini pack consists of medium wealth homes based on real life houses located in the traditional commune of Providencia in Santiago, Chile. These house were designed to fit in a W2W urban environment, just like in real life.

    **Basic information**

    \- Lot sizes: 1x2 (corner), 1x1 (corner), 2x2 and 2x1.

    \- Stages: 2, 3 and 4.

    \- Tileset: all.

    **Dependencies**

    \- Only one (which I'll stick to for future projects):

    **Note**

    I've included several versions for the corner house (last model in the pictures), so that you can choose which one to delete, if any.

    *\- R$$ Casa Julio Prado AMARILLO CALAMINA -* Yellow version with tin roof. Like in real life.

    \- *R$$ Casa Julio Prado AMARILLO TEJAS* *\-* Yellow version with roof tiles.

    \- *R$$ Casa Julio Prado BLANCO CALAMINA* - White version with tin roof. Like in real life.

    \- *R$$ Casa Julio Prado BLANCO TEJAS* - White version with roof tiles.

    Furthermore, I've included R$$$ versions since in real life the house is located in the commune of Providencia, home to upper middle income and high income families. The meaning of the R$$$ versions is the same as above.

    If you feel like these houses don't look like R$$$ homes, then simply delete the "R$$$..." folders.

    I recommend you to **abstain from deleting** the "R$$..." folders since they contain the sc4model files.
