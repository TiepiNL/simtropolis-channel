  summary: R$ Pack Santiaguino
  description: |-
    I present to you my first housing pack based on various old buildings throughout Santiago, Chile.

    These are all low-wealth, low density residential w2w houses. They grow on 1x1 and 1x2 lots. There are a total of 34 unique lots, as you can see in the pictures.

    If you like these houses, you may also like my other BATs that I'm currently working on. You can check them out [here](https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/71345-adrianors-latin-american-bats/?page=1). ![*:)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/default_1.gif ":)")

    If you have any questions, or comments, please let me know!

    Edit: I noticed I used an old picture for the primary screenshot. The textures on the last picture for the last set of houses are the final version, not the ones on the main picture. This is the only slight difference.

    Edit 2: ...I also noticed that I've uploaded this file to the wrong category.![>.<](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/default_45.gif ">.<")  It should fall under "SimCity 4 Buildings (BATs)".
