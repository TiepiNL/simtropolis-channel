#   summary: R$$ Pack Santiaguino
#   description: |-
#     **Brief Introduction**

#     This pack contains five models based on real life houses found throughout Santiago, Chile. I've included a variety of different architectural styles corresponding to different decades.

#     **Basic Information**

#     \- Lot sizes: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 1x3.

#     \- Stages: 1, 2, 3 and 4.

#     \- Tileset: all

#     \- Standard Maxis Nightlights.

#     **Dependencies**

#     More than one dependency this time. Please note that you have to be registered in order to download the files at the LEX (I guess most of you already are).

#     [BSC MEGA Props CP Vol01](https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=1180) --  really popular, most of you should already have this.

#     [BSC MEGA Props CP Vol 02](https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=2790) -- again, quite popular.

#     [LBT Mega Prop Pack vol.01](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/21770-lbt-mega-prop-pack-vol01/) --  same as the last two. Also, you should already have this if you've downloaded my previous files.

#     [Romualdillo Props VOL01](https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=3228) -- this should be the only dependency that you probably don't have yet. I also suggest checking out Romualdillo's incredibly detailed and superb spanish houses [here](https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=3229).
