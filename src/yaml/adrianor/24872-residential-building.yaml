    Hi, this is my first BAT uploaded to the STEX. It's my way of saying thanks.![2.gif](https://www.simtropolis.com/fckEditor/editor/../../forum/i/expressions/2.gif)

    This is a medium density building based on a building in front of where I live. It was supposed to be a w2w building but it didn't fit in the 1x2 lot. Anyways, I think there are lots of highrises in the STEX but there's few medium density buildings, so I decided to make this BAT. Hopefully this will be the first of a series.

    IMPORTANT: This building DOES NOT have night-lightning...so don't download it if you really care about it. It seems I can't make some decent lights...Hopefully next time I'll be able to make them.

    I didn't post any in-game pics because I couldn't get it to grow...![15.gif](https://www.simtropolis.com/fckEditor/editor/../../forum/i/expressions/15.gif) It should though (maybe i'm too impatient).

    Lot size: 2x3

    Wealth: R$$

    Dependencies: none

    Stage:4

    Criticism is welcome.
