    **DESCRIPTION**

    This file contains one set of Elevated Rail/Subway Rolling stock - A shortened version of the Glasgow Subway 3rd Generation units. The real-life Glasgow Subway is the fourth-oldest underground railway in Europe, having operated since 1896.

    There is one set, containing a locomotive and coach. Requested by [@bhmantan](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/812586-bhmantan/), these are shortened in order to better fit on the tight curves and in-road tramways added in NAM.

    These are HD and come with nightlighting. Use Dark Nite for best results.

    **INSTALLATION**

    Drag the file into your 'Plugins' folder, or install with SC4PAC (if I set the file up correctly to do so.)

    **COMPATIBILITY**

    This will replace the default El-rail loco and coach, do not use with any other replacement el-rail sets.

    **DEPENDENCIES**

    No dependencies.
