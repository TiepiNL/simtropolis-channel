  summary: CDK-OWW Seaport Village
  description: |-
    Our first specialty lot for the new **CDK Old Wooden Waterfront** style is the classic **Seaport Village**. Commonly found in most commercial ports and harbors in one form or another, the nautical themed shopping area and tourist attraction is always a winning combination and popular with locals and tourists alike.

    Our Seaport Village is a CS$$$ lot offering jobs and income from taxes. The city will need to fork out some cash to get it going but its a private enterprise and free to the city once built. This lot is designed for use  with the PEG-CDK OWW style lots... but can be used stand alone or with any of the other CDK style lots. It sits on a 6x3 tile lot, is transit enabled, and provides CS$$$ jobs and income from taxes.

    The beautiful, large yacht is also privately owned and a source of great mystery. The word on the dock is that it's the private party yacht  of the Mayor but nobody seems to know for sure... or if they do, they're not talking. But whoever owns it is one lucky son-of-a-seadog, that's for sure.

    This lot is the core piece of a series or add-on components in the works that will expand the Seaport Village into a much larger and ever-growing seaside shopping complex and tourist attraction. Add-on lots will be designed to expand The Village along the waterfront as well inland away from the water... so be sure to leave room in your cities.

    There are two unique stats listed in the query; Postcards Sold This Month & Reported Seagull Bombings. The Postcards Sold value is dictated by the city's population. The larger the city... the more postcards that will sell. Seagull Bombings are influenced by the current Mayor Rating and you can use this to gauge your performance.. The higher the rating, the fewer the bombings. If  fewer than 25 bombings are reported, then you are doing a pretty good job..

    **\*\***This lot requires the installation of the **[PEG CDK-OWW Development Kit Volume 1](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/12007-peg-cdkoww-development-pack-vol-1/) &
     [PEG CDK-REC Prop Pack Volume 1](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/11775-pegcdk-rec-prop-pack-1/)** which are also available here at this site.
