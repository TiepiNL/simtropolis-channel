  summary: Foss Construction Tower Crane
  description: |-
    Tower crane and its tower.

    The tower unit is 12m high, so should be raised by 12m every time to make a larger tower. Then the crane should go at a multiple of 12m hight.

    UPDATE: Added new crane, and fised the problem with the placement outlines when in the LotEditor.

    UPDATE: Added site hoarding, and Caterpiller Crane.
