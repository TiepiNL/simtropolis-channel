    You guys remember TEAM:Max that once was here right? Well its still alive at [http://s13.zetaboards.com/Sim\_City\_4\_Kingdom/forum/42693/,](http://s13.zetaboards.com/Sim_City_4_Kingdom/forum/42693/,) anyway, I made a truck for it as I'm a part of the team. This truck is UDI. It also comes with a prop version.

    Give 100% of the credit for the model to Simfanatik.,

    I just Re-skinned it and re-modded it. Hope you guys enjoy it. ![:thumb:](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaThumb.gif)
