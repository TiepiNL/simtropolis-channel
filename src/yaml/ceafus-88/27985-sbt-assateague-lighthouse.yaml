  summary: SBT-Assateague Lighthouse
  description: |-
    Hello Simtropolis!  
      
    The Simmania BAT Team is back again for another release! The 6th official release of the newly reformed team!   
    This one is a lighthouse based of the Assateague Lighthouse. It comes in 4 varieties listed below:  
      
    1\. Grass Version  
    2\. Sand Version  
    3\. Transparent Base Version  
    4\. Island Water Version  
      
    The lot is 4x4, and blank with grass, sand or transparent. The reason I left them as a blank lot with no props, is so people could make it fit in with their city, how they needed to either through LE, or MMP, it lets them tell the tale of their city, their way.   
      
    The lots will be found under the rewards menu, just look for the lighthouse icon!  
      
    It requires no power to be ran to it, so it could be easily placed in remote areas, and flora put around it without the dealings with power lines, or windmill's obstructing the scene.  
      
    If you do not see it light up at night, there are a couple reasons:  
      
    \*You plopped it at night  
    \*You don't have the update patch  
      
    So make sure you have the patch (as most do). And you plop it during the day. It will take a minute to light up, so it is recommended to put the speed on cheetah for about 3 seconds, then turn it back to your speed, and the lighthouse will be lit up.  
      
    Thanks for downloading, rating, and commenting!
