  description: |-
    Hello, have you been wondering how your sims get thier fireworks to the firework stand? Well wonder no more, because I have created a firework truck pack to help your sims deliver fireworks, all credits to Simfanatik for the model, I just reskinned and re-modded it. Your sim can also drive it.

    Its a UDI Addon Pack. The fireworks brands included are

    \*Black Cat Fireworks

    \*TNT Fireworks

    \*World Class Fireworks

    \*Phantom Fireworks

    No Dependencies ![:thumb:](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaThumb.gif)
