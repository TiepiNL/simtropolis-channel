  description: |-
    Hello Simtropolis. I know it has been a long time, a really long time, since I have released a BAT. I finished up some team duties, and I am back for more lol. Anyway, I am here to present to you a project I worked on over at Simmania.  
      
    This is a 1x2 Lot containing a music store named Bring The Razed.  
      
    This is a CS$$ that provides 45 Jobs.
