  summary: Tornado Alarm
  description: |-
    Hello there, my other tornado file got removed from the STEX, so that engouraged me to make another, only this time its different, when you place a tornado in your cities, all you have to do is Query this alarm, and it will sound the alarm! You don't even have to stay on the query, you can go do other things, but this will play till the end of the alarm, if the alarm goes off before the tornado is over, simply query it again. **A special thanks to FANTA1990** for modding this for me, he also made the icon, and made it where it is a transparent Base texture to fit any terrian!

    Located under power menu (Thats the way FANTA1990 made it, so please no negitive comments over it)
