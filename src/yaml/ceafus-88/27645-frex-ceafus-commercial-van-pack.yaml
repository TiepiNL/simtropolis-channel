  summary: Frex_Ceafus Commercial Van Pack
  description: |-
    Hello guys, I am here to bring you my latest project.

    It is a commercial van pack. I saw Simfanitik's wonderful van models on the STEX and thought, wow these could be used for commercial vans, so I downloaded it, and took the textures and made them with logos and different colors. I then went to 3ds max and changed the UWV Wrapping on them to give you what you see now.

    I hope you enjoy them, and please,

    Rate and Comment.

    Thanks!
