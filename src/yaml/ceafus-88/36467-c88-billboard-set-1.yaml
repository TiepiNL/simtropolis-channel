  summary: C88- Billboard Set 1
  description: |-
    Good evening Simtropolis,

    They are on every roadside across America and the world. Ruining landscapes and helping people get lawyers, roadside snacks, and fuel.

    In this pack I created a mix of realistic and fictional billboards for your cities. In total there are 44 unique billboards. I have separated them into their own folders for your convenience to sort through the ones you may or may not want. A huge thank you to the members that let me use their usernames and BAT businesses for this, it made for some fun spins on things. ![:}](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/default_48.gif ":}")

    All have included nitelighting, minus the 2 "abandoned" billboards.

    Located under the Parks Menu.

    No Dependencies!

    Thank you as always! ![*:)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/default_1.gif "*:)")
