  summary: Larger Tornado MOD
  description: |-
    Hello. I am here to present my latest mod. I think it is best described in story.

    Think. If you were a tornado. Would you rather be a puny F3 MAxis default tornado, or a Massive F5 Frex\_Ceafus Tornado? Well, to control your destiny, you must download this mod, so you too, can be a F5 Tornado.

    The End.

    This mod is simply a replacement of the maxis tornado. A large upscale of it.

    Also, if your tired of only half of your trailer parks getting destroyed, you can get this to destroy the whole thing ![:)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaSmile.gif)
