  summary: Restaurant Dumpsters
  description: |-
    Do your sim's resturants need a place to dump their trash, but do not want the trash to be in their lot?? Well, this lot is located under the trash menu, these dumpsters get rid of 500 trash per month, and only take up 1 square. These will start reducing your Sim's Resturants' trash as soon as you download, enjoy!!
