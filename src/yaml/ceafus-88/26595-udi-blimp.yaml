  summary: SC4 UDI Blimp
  description: |-
    Hello there, we all have seen the noble blimp flying in our SimCity skies, but haven't you always wanted to drive one, well wait no more, for I have made the blimp UDI and you can drive it now for only one click of the download button, but there is a catch, it replaces the skydiver plane, but comes with a bonus, it still drops parachuters, enjoy this little gift from Frex\_Ceafus.

    Enjoy!
