  summary: 1x1 Slope Conforming Wind Power Plant Without Grass Texture
  description: |-
    This is a simple 1x1 slope conforming wind power plant without grass texture.

    It has the same values and costs as the default wind power plant but with a reduced size.

    I recommend you to not plop those power plants too close to each other because the propellers will go through each others and it won't look very realistic.

    This is my first BAT so if you find any mistakes in values or stuff like that send me a pm and I will try to fix them!

    Original idea : Cogeo
