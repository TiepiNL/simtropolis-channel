  summary: NDEX ITS 110 Cannon Street
  description: |-
    Another City of London building. 110 Cannon Street is an 11 storey building that just sort of blends in with the other low-midrise. Nothing offensive, but nothing eye catching either. It serves it's purpose though and will soon be surrounded with 21st century development. I found this one whilst looking at London's ugliest buildings, I don't find this one ugly but some of the crass surrounding it...
