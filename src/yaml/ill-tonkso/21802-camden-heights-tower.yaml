  summary: Camden Heights Tower
  description: |-
    I created this imaginary, generic building to patch a hole in one of my cities secondary CBD's as the local tallest building. Camden Heights is not too tall, not too short.

    Camden Heights comes with both a ploppable and 2 growable lots, each with 2300 CO£££ jobs. Each lot occupies 4x4 tiles.
