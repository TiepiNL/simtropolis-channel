  summary: Parking Lots by Ardecila
  description: |-
    There are three sizes of parking lots included in this download: "Civic", "Shops", and "Transit".  Civic is a 6x6 lot meant for downtown areas.  It increases CS demand and pays your city $75/month.  It has a functional capacity of 5,000.  Shops is a 5x6 lot designed to be plopped in front of suburban-style "Big Box" stores or supermarkets.  It increases CS demand slightly, but not as much as the Civic.  Transit is a 2x6 lot, suggested by ST member Nardo69, meant to be plopped near train or subway stations.  It acts like the default ingame garage, with a functional capacity of 3000.

    All 3 lots are transit-enabled for streets.  Remember, you cannot zone onto these lots like you would to a normal street!  You need a normal street to touch the store, either on the back or side.  Then you can plop the parking lot in front of the building.  I have tested this thoroughly, and the building will not dilapidate.

    *External downloads required for use of this lot (2):*

    **Custom Textures:** none! (all are included)
    **Custom Props:** [BSC MEGA Props - SG Vol 01](https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=746)
    **LUA Script:**  [BSC Essentials](https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=443)
    **Query:** none!

    The BSC Essentials download provides the functionality nessecary for features of the NDEX
    custom queries.  You must install this if you wish to see these custom queries.  The file
    bsc\_Essentials\_OG.dat is no longer distributed with NDEX downloads and the above link
    should be used instead.

    **Functionality and lotwork by Ardecila.**
