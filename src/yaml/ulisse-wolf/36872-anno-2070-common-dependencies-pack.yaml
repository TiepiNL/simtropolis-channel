    **Anno 2070 - Common Dependencies Pack**

    This Common Dependencies Pack contains the entire set of props coming from Anno 2070

    Please note that this pack **is** expected to receive updates in the near future. Do not redistribute without asking first, mostly as doing so would complicate efforts to properly maintain, update, and provide technical support for the pack.

    ### INSTALLATION:

    This package utilizes a Java-based installer (similar to the one used with the Network Addon Mod), and can also be opened and installed manually using 7-Zip or Keka.

    To install it, you'll either need the Java Runtime Environment to run the installer--[Adoptium's open-source edition is recommended](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases)\--or a zip tool capable of opening the installer to allow manual installation. For Windows/Linux, use [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/), and for macOS, use [Keka](https://www.keka.io/en/).

    Once into the installer, after agreeing to the terms for the package, click to the Files tab to select which dependencies you wish to install (making no changes here will install everything). Then, click to the Location tab to set up an installation location (this should be the root of your My DocumentsSimCity 4Plugins folder). After this, click over to the Install tab, and click "Start installation" to begin the installation procedure. When installation is complete, the tab pop up a message indicating it, after which you are safe to close the installer.

    It is highly recommended to run the cleanitol with the installer and remove any previous versions from your plugins.  
    Optionally in the ~Documents folder in the main ZIP you can find a collective/master and separately all the individual cleanitol files and by using either the newer **[nos.17's SC4 Cleanitol](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/35790-sc4-cleanitol/)** or the older **[BSC Cleanitol](index.php/downloads/download/30-gameplay-utilities/18-bsc-cleanitol)** tool you can search and remove old and outdated versions of these files.

    Bear in mind that this Collection contains Prop packs only available with this upload. Those prop packs can be used and referenced by other contents may not part of this collection as dependencies. If a 3rd party upload references one of the prop packs available in this Collection, you don't need to install everything, you can select and install only the referenced prop pack. All prop packs (and the lot packs as well) have individual cleanitol files (besides the Cleanitol\_MASTER REMOVE LIST\_ Anno2070\_Common\_Dependencies\_Pack.txt) and they have Prop Catalogue index images as a help for lotters.
