  summary: German Themed 220kV high voltage pylons (HD)
  description: |-
    Hi all!  
    its been more than a year since i released something!  
    and i finally completed the German set i promised ages ago!  
    These new pylons have tons of little changes including a more realistic height and alot of new details.  
    but thats not all The sets are bigger now including even more pylons like  
    \-Anchor pylons  
    \-Switch pylons  
    \-Rivercrossing pylons.  
      
    The pylons are in real life arround 30 meters(or slightly higher)  
    and in simmeter its arround 60(because sims are 4 meters long)  
      
    So they dont fit that well with my older models  
      
    For more info check out the readme wich you can find VVV and in the rar file.  
    have fun!  
      
    This set will eventually get an expansion pack including diagonal switch, anchor and river crossing pylons. but also more substation models and another pylon model.

    \---------------------------------------  
    Models and lot files are created by Buzzit.  
    \---------------------------------------  
    This package contains the following files:  
    1x Straight pylon(model+lot)  
    1x diagonal pylon(model+lot)  
    1x Corner pylon left(model+lot)  
    1x Corner pylon right(model+lot)  
    1x Corner Pylon 90 degree(model+lot)  
    1x Substation pylon(model+lot)  
    1x Anchor pylon(model+lot)  
    1x Switch pylon((model+lot)  
    1x Rivercrossing pylon(model+lot)  
    No dependencies required!  
      
    \---------------------------------------  
    Whats new?  
    \- pylons are twice the size of the other sets.  
    This time i used a character to help me modeling. After i knew that sims are accually 4 meters instead of 2 i remodeld  
    my standards to fit this. Thats why my pylons look so big compared to some maxis buildings. allthough they fit quite nicely  
    with newer/custom buildings.  
    \-More details:  
    This one speaks for it self. The pylons now have more details.  
    \- Darker textures on the pylon it self with little dirt and rust spots.  
    \-More pylon types including anchor switch and river crossing pylons.  
      
    \---------------------------------------  
    Known issues  
    \- The pylons catch fire sometimes. i dont know why these pylons do that. as my other sets arent having this glitch.  
    to fix this just send your firefighters to controle the flames hehe ![:D](https://www.simtropolis.com/forum/public/style_emoticons/)  
    if they catch fire alot. come back here and tell me i will seriously look into it furter more.(but as far as i know they dont catch fire that much)  
      
    \- You cant place trees arround and under the pylons. if you do want to have vegitation. first demolish the pylon and  
    after that add the vegitiation you like(but this glitch is accually realistic lol.)  
      
    \---------------------------------------  
    This set contains 9 220kV double circuit one-level pylons wich are based on RL models.  
    the corner, straight and special pylons are all power-eye-candy.  
    But the substation pylons act like actual powerplants(wich generate about 2000MW) wich means  
    you don't need to plop a new powerplant or use a power cheat  
    everytime you create a new map.  
    The pylons aren't slope friendly and should only be used on flat ground.  
    Feel free to use the pylons for your own powerlots under the condition  
    that you give me credit for the pylons themselves.  
    If you have any issues place the issue on the forums of SC4D or Simtropolis and i will try to solve them ASAP  
      
    Have fun!
