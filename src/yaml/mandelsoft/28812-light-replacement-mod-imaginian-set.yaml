  description: |-
    This mod adds (fictional) Imaginian styled streetlights and optionally it can replace all in-game streetlights. 8 new streetlight types (24 models in total), included with a more uniform light spreading, making your cities look great from far too.

    **Installation**

    Installation is quite simple: just put the right files into your plugins folder. The following files are included:

    • *LightCones\_DarkNite.dat*

    • *LightCones\_MaxisNite.dat*

    • *Models & Props.dat*

    Contains all models and prop descriptors for this pack. Must be installed!

    • *Ploppable Lights.dat*

    Optional. Contains several sets of ploppable lights.

    • *Override Set.dat*

    Optional. Replaces all in-game streetlights with Imaginian styled streetlights. Also contains enhanced T21\-exemplar setups for more variety.

    **Uninstallation**

    To uninstall the pack, remove the files from this mod from your Plugins folder.
