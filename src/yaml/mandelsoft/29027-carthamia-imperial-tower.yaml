  summary: Carthamia Imperial Tower
  description: |-
    The **Imperial Tower of Carthamia** (a fictional country by **Katherman111**) is a broadcasting tower built in Pötama, the Carthamian capital city. This 500m tall tower, completed in 1986 services three purposes. First, it’s a broadcasting tower for TV and cell phone transmissions. Second, it’s a tourist attraction, offering a panoramic view over the city in the Sky Restaurant in the Sphere at 360m above the ground. Third, it is a war monument to celebrate the victory over the Tholenian occupation in 1981.  
       
    With its all-round presence, this tower dominates the skyline of Pötama and is therefore a well-known Carthamian landmark.

    Special thanks to Arne (**Katherman111**) for inspiring me to make this BAT!
