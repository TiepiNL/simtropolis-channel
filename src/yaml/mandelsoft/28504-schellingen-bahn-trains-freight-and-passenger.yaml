  summary: Schellingen Bahn Trains (Freight and Passenger)
  description: |-
    This file replaces the standard freight locomotive with a Class 460 electric freight engine, painted in the style of the fictional Schellingen Bahn livery (SB). There's also a replacement of the passenger train with a Class 460-like engine, both locomotive and carriages. No further changes are made, this mod is only visual.

    Just unpack one or both files (depending one what you want to replace) into you plugins folder to install the mod to make it appear on your tracks. This mod will be applied automatically. For un-installation, simply delete these files from your plugins folder in order to use another freight engine model.

    Enjoy!
