    This file replaces the standard freight locomotive with a Class 460 electric freight engine, painted in the style of the Swiss Railway company (SBB). No further changes are made, this mod is only visual.

    Just unpack this file into you plugins folder to install the mod to make it appear on your tracks. This mod will be applied automatically. For un-installation, simply delete this file from your plugins folder in order to use another freight engine model.

    Enjoy!
