  summary: PKP Warsaw Station Halt (Warszawa Powisle)
  description: |-
    One of the Warsaw's railway halt stations designed by the architects A. Romanowicz and P. Szymaniak. The station was opened in 1963. Its most notable features are the wide usage of the concrete shell roofs and the place where it has been located - right next to the Vistula river escarpment and entrance to the railway tunnel below the downtown.

    **The add-on consists of four pieces** to make it more universal:

    1\. Platforms – work as railway station (capacity: 15000 passengers)

    2\. Upper Pavilion - the function and capacity same like above

    3\. Lower Pavilion – works as bus stop (capacity: 5000 passengers)

    4\. Lower Pavilion in alternative version (w/o neon) - the function and capacity of the above

    (Also see the pics below)

    **Dependencies:**

    This add-on doesn’t require any other plug-ins to work(!), however to properly model the terrain, it is recommended to use the Hold Diggers and Raisers included with the NAM.

    If you plan to place the platforms at the embankment in more realistic way, it is also recommended to have NAM:

    Exactly you will need the NAM „Ped. mall” pieces (road menu), to connect platforms with the bus stop (the one from this set or different one).
