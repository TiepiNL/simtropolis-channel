  summary: Jubiler, Warsaw
  description: |-
    The model was inspired by real building built in Warsaw in 1957 and designed by the arch. Jan Bogusławski (see links below). Despite it has the most characteristic architectural detail and features of the real block (like jewelery store “Jubiler”, Bar Praha and neons), there are also few differences and it was not meant to be the exact reproduction.  
      
    I made this building in **3 parts** (2 x 3x2 and 1 x 1x2) to have more possibilities of “plopping” in game.  
    All 3 are **CS$$ Plops** and together offer about 700 jobs.  
      
    Those were my first BATs (hope they are not that bad – many thanks to Ferox and other members of the “SimCity Polska” for tips, how to use the architect tool.
