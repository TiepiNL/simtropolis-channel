  summary: Parking Lots (Road Set) and Car Props
  description: |-
    A small addition to the SC4 parking lots theme - set of the functional car parks to plop on roads and one-way roads. **47** **pieces** in total - in different sizes, with different types of parking spaces (parallel, diagonal, mixed), with various types of trees (no trees, Maxis trees, semi-seasonal trees) and lots of different vehicles.

    This set comes together with a prop pack of my simple car models from the 60s and 70s - **MS\_Motokloss\_60s-70s\_CarProps**. About 60 old European vehicles in several variants (parallel, diagonal and “less diagonal” ![https://www.simtropolis.com/forum/public/style_emoticons/default/2.gif](https://www.simtropolis.com/forum/public/style_emoticons/default/2.gif) ).

    More info. in “read me” files - please check them.

    **DEPENDENCIES:**

    \- **BSC MEGA Props - CP Vol01** - for the semi seasonal trees. It is required ONLY if you want to use the version with these trees.  
    [http://sc4devotion.c...php?lotGET=1180](https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=1180)

    \- MS Motokloss 60s-70s Car Props - **INCLUDED** in this download.

    **IMPORTANT** \- some people can't see the parallel asphalt parking spaces due to the "conflict" with some different plugin\*. If you are one of them, please **rename the folder "Motokloss" to "zzzMotokloss"** to set it at the end of the loading queue. It should solve the problem. Many thanks to yigit007, who discovered this solution (see comments below).

    \*It doesn't happen every time. I tested these parking lots in different plugin configs and never had any troubles, same with other users.

    \_\_\_\_\_  
    Notice, the pics below were taken with the loaded NAM Euro-road texture. If you do not use NAM or this texture, you will see the standard US yellow lines (in case of the two-way road pieces).
