  summary: House of Artist (Dom Artysty Plastyka), Warsaw
  description: |-
    "Dom Artysty Plastyka" (~"House of Artist") - exhibition and office building from Warsaw, designed by the architect Jerzy Kumelowski and erected in the years 1963-66.

    Perhaps the most characteristic feature here, is the original 19th century gate (re)used in the role of fence/curtain, which separates the building and its small "cold-tone" minimalist courtyard from the street. As a kind of monument, the gate has been mostly saved in its post-WW2 condition with traces of fire and many holes made by the bullets.  
      
    In game as:  
    **Plop - museum, lot 2x2**, capacity 3000  
    **Plop - school/college, lots 2x2 and 2x3**, capacity 1000  
    **Plop - diagonal college, 1x1**, capacity 1000 (grey or brown/sandstone pavement to choose)  
      
    **Grow - CO$$$5, lots 2x2 and 2x3**, 300 workers.  
      
    This is generally a W2W building, but it has been bated in such way, that can be used also as a stand alone one (if someone really wants).

    "MS Al. Przyjaciół 3"  - version 2 or later (needed for the diagonals only):
