  summary: Marszalkowska Street 74, Warsaw
  description: |-
    The BAT is inspired by the real W2W residential building located in the Warsaw downtown. It was designed in the mid-50s and built around 1959/1960 in place of the destroyed during the WWII tenement.

    Originally, in the 60s, there was a big electronic store at the ground floor - it was "reproduced" in this model. ![2.gif](https://www.simtropolis.com/forum/public/style_emoticons/default/2.gif)

    This plug-in contains also fictional **mirror version** of the building.

    Both models are available in game as:

    \- **CS$$ - plop and grow** (117/119 jobs)

    \- **R$$ - grow** (~206 residents)

    The lot size is 3x1.

    **NO DEPENDENCIES.**
