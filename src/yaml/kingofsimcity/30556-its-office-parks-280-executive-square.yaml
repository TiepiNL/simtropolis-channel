    *KOSC Presents: **280 Executive Square***

    **Introduction**  
      
    This is the sixth set of lots in my **ITS Office Park** series. ***280 Executive*** is a return to my monotonous, massive campus-style of office complexes with one of my personal favorite of **Ill Tonkso**’s BATs: **280 Bishopgate**. This time around I wanted to experiment with layout and FAR conformity and as such, the total complex takes up a huge amount of real estate.

    **Package Overview**

    **280 Executive Square** is a massive 6 building hi-spec office complex for your middle class sims. The campus is dotted with trees and boasts many open spaces, including parks and ponds. On the open walkways you’ll find fountain plazas and shady benches for relaxation. The complex is also very bike friendly, with tons of bike racks scattered throughout.

    Included in the following package are a total of **12** lots, which included **8** growables and **4** ploppables. The actual complex is pieced together from four lots (labelled as *Phase 1-4/Buildings A-F*). There are 2 different growable commercial versions (*CO$$ and CS$$*) in order to satisfy the endless stream of service demand that large cities often experience. The ploppable version is only available in CO$$, and comes with custom menu icons. If for whatever reason you want to plop the service version, you can use Buggi's buildingPlop cheat and find the lots. (prefixed with *KOSC ITS 280 Executive \_name\_)*

    **General Stats**

    All ploppables are located near the top of the landmarks menu.

    All growables will grow starting from **Low-Density.**

    **Phase 1 and 4** ploppables have **Transit-Enabled** tiles so be careful when playing around them with NAM!
