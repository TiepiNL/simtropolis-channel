  summary: ITS Office Parks - Lakeside Place
  description: |-
    *KOSC presents: **Lakeside Place***

    **Introduction**  
      
    This is the fifth set of lots in my **ITS Office Park** series. Unlike my previous releases, this one is in its purest form, a relot of the original **1000 Lakeside**. I found the original rather underwhelming in terms of both detail and size and decided to take that up to ten. Additionally, with the hype of **Cities: Skylines** in recent times, I decided to build this lot in 3 different environments to coincide with the 3 distinct biomes in Skylines (**boreal, temperate, and tropical**).

    **Package Overview**  
      
    **Lakeside Place (1000 Lakeside)** is a massive, high-end office building that was built for satisfying never ending commerical demand. The complex boasts massive parking spaces as well as a large, tree-lined walkway facing the entrance of the building. Lakeside Place is perfect as the centerpiece for your business parks.  
      
    Included in the following package are a total of **3** ploppable versions. There are no growables this time around due to the sheer size of the lot.

    **General Stats**

    This one has a little more dependencies than usual, but they're staples as far as custom content is concerned. As always, if you've downloaded any of my previous ITS Office Park lots, you should have most if not all of the required texture/prop dependencies.  
      
    All credit goes to **Ill Tonkso** for the great BAT!

    Enjoy!
