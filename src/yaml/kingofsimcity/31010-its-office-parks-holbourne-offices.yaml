    *KOSC presents: **Holbourne Offices***

    **Introduction**

    This is the **9th** set of lots in my **ITS Office Park** series. **Holbourne House** is another rather generic mid-rise from **Ill Tonkso's** **City Set** that fits well in an urban setting as well as part of a suburban office complex. While I have lotted this one before as part of my very first complex release, I felt that the individual buildings were worthy contenders as standalones.

    **Package Overview**

    **Holbourne Offices** comes with several different growable configurations and orientations. The centerpiece ploppable in the set is a large 10x10 semi-symmetrical complex with a couple of parking extender lots. Addtionally, all growable lots also boast parking lots with multiple entrances and were designed for expansion in mind. Like many office complexes in the suburban US, parking lots can sprawl several blocks and in all sorts of shapes and sizes and thus these growables were meant to play well with the **SP Modular Parking Set**.  
      
    Included in the following package are a total of **9** lots: 6 CO$$ growables, one CO$$$ ploppable and two parking lots disguised as parks. There are two different packages, the standard version and a **LITE** version. The LITE version is an adaptation that removes a lot of the perimeter CP seasonal trees and emphasizes open space and user preference. These were specifically made to cater to users that prefer their own choice of MMP trees and plants.

    If you do need to plop the growables, use the **buildingPlop** cheat and look for exemplars starting at **KOSC ITS \_\_buildingName\_\_ (requires ExtraCheats.dll)**
