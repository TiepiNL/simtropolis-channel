    *KOSC presents: **The Forsaken Ones - Two Eastland Grand Station (2015)***

    **Introduction**

    This lot is the **2nd release** in the **Forsaken Ones** series.

    **2 Eastland Grand** is a rail station that was originally slated to be a part of an **ITS Office Parks** set featuring **Ill Tonkso's** entire Eastland Grand series. Due to the age of the buildings in particular, the entire project was ultimately scrapped. However, this particular station was completed at the time and therefore is the sole survivor of the set. I've decided to go ahead and upload this remnant to the STEX.

    **Package Overview**  
      
    Included in the following package is a single passenger rail station lot.

    **General Stats**

    Two Eastland Grand Station boasts the following stats:

    -   7x8 lot (transit-enabled with dual rail lines)
    -   $10,000 plop cost, $200 monthly maintenance cost
    -   50,000 capacity

    Additionally, the station has a total capacity of 1300 civic jobs, spread among all wealth levels.

    Detailed stats and information can be found in the enclosed README.

    **Install Instructions**

    Drop the files in your **My Documents/SimCity 4/Plugins** folder.

    **Dependencies**
