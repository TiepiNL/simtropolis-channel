    *KOSC presents: **Simgoober's Large Shopping Center Relot, Sunny SoCal Style***

    **Introduction**

    This is a realistic re-lot attempt of one of Simgoober's classic MEGA sized strip mall lots for the **Classic Model, New Lot** challenge**.** The lot was redone in a Southern California theme with giant fan palms lining each parking block. More variations will eventually be available once this building has been fully integrated into my **Retail Mania (ReM)** series.

    **Package Overview**  
      
    Included in the following package is a single **GROWABLE** CS$$ lot. This massive shopping center takes advantage of the extra space with copious parking space, including several accessibility sections. Improvements over the original include stops, crosswalks and a massive extended rear parking section.

    If you desire to plop the lot, use the **buildingPlop** cheat and look for the exemplar **KOSC\_SC\_LargeShoppingCenter.**

    **General Stats**

    ***Large Shopping Center***

    *Lot Sizes: 14x9*  
    *Growth Stage: 1*  
    *Service Capacity:  569 CS$$, 2269 CS$ when dilapidated*  
    *Density Requirement: Low*  
    *Power/Water: 46/548*  
    *Pollution at Center A/W/G/R: 21/14/28/0*  
    *Pollution Radius A/W/G/R: 5/6/0/0*

    This building grows on ALL tilesets, and is also **Transit Enabled.** Due to the incredibly low chance that something will replace this lot after it has grown, I decided to make this a TE growable lot.

    **Install Instructions**

    Drop the files in your **My Documents/SimCity 4/Plugins** folder.
