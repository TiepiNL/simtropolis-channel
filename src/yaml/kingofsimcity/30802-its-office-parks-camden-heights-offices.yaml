    *KOSC presents: **CAMden Heights Offices***

    **Introduction**

    This is the eighth set of lots in my **ITS Office Park** series. **CAMden Heights** is a nice mid-rise, nondescript office tower that serves its purpose as the centerpiece in suburban office parks. Or an eyesore among an entire district of generic buildings... yeah, might as well be.

    **Package Overview**

    **CAMden Heights Offices** is a small collection of growables and a ploppable of **Ill Tonksoâ€™s Camden Heights Tower.** There are two smaller lots are occupied by one tower each, both which boast relatively tame scenery. The centerpiece is the massive 10x10 complex featuring twin towers with an ample parking lot with garage, lush greenery, and a beautiful front plaza.  
    Included in the following package are a total of **3** lots: two **CO$$ growables** and one **CO$$ ploppable.** The ploppable one can be found in the landmarks menu near the top.

    If you do need to plop the growables, use the **buildingPlop** cheat and look for exemplars starting at **KOSC ITS \_\_buildingName\_\_**
