    *KOSC Presents: Ill Tonkso's 110 Cannon Street*

    **Introduction**

    This is the **12th** set of lots in my **ITS Office Park** series. **110 Cannon Street** is a nice little mid-sized office tower by **Ill Tonkso** re-purposed for a more suburban setting.

    **Package Overview**  
      
    The original building was greatly expanded upon to encompass several different lot configurations. Growables included have larger footprints and large parking structures like those found in many larger suburban office complexes. The ploppable lot is a highlight massive 10x10 office complex, boasting twin towers with matching entrances. A grand avenue entrance leads directly to the massive rear parking lot which includes a parking garage as well as an asymmetric parking lot design.

    Included in the following package are a total of 5 lots: 4 CO$$ growables and one CO$$$ ploppable. Growable lots contain only a single building while the centerpiece complex boasts two. Additionally, the ploppable complex is transit enabled.

    If you desire to plop the growables, use the **buildingPlop** cheat and look for exemplars starting at "**KOSC ITS 110 Cannon" (requires ExtraCheats.dll)**

    **General Stats**

    The included growable lots will provide **1098 CO$$** jobs. They are available in the following configurations:

    -   4x8 left corner, stage 5
    -   7x4 front, stage 5
    -   3x4, 6x6 front, stage 6

    The ploppable lot is located in the landmarks menu and provides **1534** ****CO$$$**** jobs in the following configuration:

    -   10x10, $100,000 plop cost

    Detailed stats and information can be found in the enclosed README.
