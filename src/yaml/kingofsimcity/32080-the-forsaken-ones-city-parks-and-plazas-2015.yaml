  summary: The Forsaken Ones - City Parks and Plazas (2015)
  description: |-
    *KOSC presents: **The Forsaken Ones - City Parks and Plazas (2015)***

    **Introduction**

    There's a ton of leftover lots I have sitting on my hard drive in an unfinished/near-finished state dating all the way back to mid-2015. **The Forsaken Ones** is a series dedicated to those lots/packs which I feel is decent enough to warrant a look again and as such, I've tidied up a few of the leftovers and packaged them together.

    **City Parks and Plazas** was originally meant to be a large park/plaza pack back in **2015**. The original idea included FA2 conforming plazas and a vast variety of other seasonal parks and plazas for more urban areas. As I ultimately got sidetracked with parking textures shortly after the creation of the first parks, the rest of the set never came to fruition.

    **Package Overview**  
      
    Included in the following package is a set of **4** park lots.

    **General Stats**

    The 4 parks/plazas in this set consist of the following:

    -   1 small high-wealth plaza, providing small amounts but full R$, R$$ and R$$$ cap relief.
    -   1 medium-wealth plaza, 1 medium-wealth park, providing residential as well as commercial office cap relief
    -   1 larger high-wealth park, providing full residential as well as commercial office cap relief

    In addition, all parks share the following properties:

    -   Air pollution reduction, light water pollution
    -   Moderate to strong landmark effects within a short radius, park effects over a larger radius (relative to park size)

    By default, the parks should appear early on in the parks menu.

    Detailed stats and information can be found in the enclosed README.

    **Install Instructions**

    Drop the files in your **My Documents/SimCity 4/Plugins** folder.

    **Dependencies**

    This is an oldie so the dependency listing is considerably shorter.
