  summary: MEH Office Parks - Medium Wealth Pack
  description: |-
    **Overview:**  
    This is the second set of my MEH Office Park series focused exclusively on medium wealth buildings. This is a larger package encompassing 3 building types: 2 of the buildings have 8 different lot layouts between them while the last one has two. This makes for a grand total of **18** different office lots.  
      
    **Building Stats:**  
    **LaVine Office Park (LaVine Management) (2x/3x/4x)**  
    *2x Capacity: 369 CO$$ jobs  
    3x Capacity: 553 CO$$ jobs*

    **4x Capacity: 736 CO$$ jobs**  
    *Houston Tileset*  
       
    **Calamity Office Park (Chuck Calamity Info. Center) (2x/3x/4x)**  
    *2x Capacity: 327 CO$$ jobs  
    3x Capacity: 490 CO$$ jobs*  
    **4x Capacity: 652 CO$$ jobs**  
    *Euro Tileset*

    **Downend Office Park (Downend Entertainment) (3x/4x)**

    *3x Capacity: 206 CO$$ jobs*

    **4x Capacity: 310 CO$$ jobs**  
    *Houston Tileset*

    All buildings can grow starting at *Low Density* and have basic BTE tracking enabled.  
      
    **Possible Lot Configurations****/Stages**

    **LaVine/Calamity**  
    2 Buildings: **3x5, 5x4** (Stage 4, LC and RC)

    3 Buildings: **6x5, 3x9, 3x9** (Stage 4, Front, LC and RC)

    4 Buildings: **6x6, 3x9, 3x9** (Stage 4/5, RC, RC and LC)

    **Downend**

    3 Buildings: **3x5** (Stage 4, LC)

    4 Buildings: **5x5** (Stage 4, RC)

    As with before, the lots are designed to complement vanilla/Maxis SC4 and as such require no external dependencies other than Maxis Buildings as Props (bldgprop\_vol1 and vol2). I HIGHLY recommend using [TWrecks' Maxis Prop Names and Query Fix](https://community.simtropolis.com/index.php?app=downloads&showfile=22400) as a substitute. Enjoy, and make sure to zone responsibly! Excessive repetition complaints will be redirected to Simnation's construction bureau.
