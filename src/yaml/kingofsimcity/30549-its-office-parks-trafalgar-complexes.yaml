  summary: ITS Office Parks - Trafalgar Complexes
  description: |-
    *KOSC presents: **Trafalgar Complexes***  
      
    **Introduction**  
      
    This is the fourth set of lots in my **ITS Office Park** series. I was originally going to release this around 2 months ago, but the beast that was Skylines took me out of my SC4 mood ![:)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaSmile.gif). In a slight departure from previous releases of the series, this lot is multi-purposed for not only offices, but also residential and services. Originally there were supposed to be more lot variants, but due to the nature of the building and the age of it, I decided not to proceed forward. Therefore, this is in a sense, a TIOLI (take it or leave it) lot.  
      
    **Package Overview**  
      
    **Trafalgar Complexes** is a reinmagination of Ill Tonkso's original **Trafalgar Hall** BAT, which was a small, standalone midrise. There are two distinct variants, but all of them share the same layout. The office version is marked by the concrete pavement, while the hotel and condominium versions have dark asphalt pavement with brickwork in the main driveway.  
      
    Included in the following package are a total of 3 growables versions (1 for **CO**, **CS** and **R**). There are no ploppable versions this time around. However, you can use the BuildingPlop cheat from Extra Cheats to plop them if you wish (all the lot exemplars are prefixed with *KOSC ITS \_buildingname\_* ). As always, a custom prop exemplar for the building is included in order to simulate multi-building lots.
