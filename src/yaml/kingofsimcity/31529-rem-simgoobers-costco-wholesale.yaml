    *KOSC Presents: RetailMania - Simgoober's Costco Wholesale*

    **Introduction**

    **Costco Wholesale** is the **3rd** release from my **RetailMania** series. This is a set of re-lots for Simgoober's classic **Costco Retail** BAT aimed at expanding the retail location to include more than just the club warehouse.

    **Package Overview**

    These lots are redone to better coincide with their real-life counterparts and feature things like the food court, auto center and gas station. A set of custom gas station textures was created to better emulate the road markings found in actual Costco locations across the United States.  
      
    Included in the following package are a set of custom textures and 4 lots: 3 CS$$ growables and 1 CS$$ ploppable landmark with jobs. The ploppable landmark only utilizes one of the 3 possible growable layouts. Both types share the same stats as follows:

    If you desire to plop the growables, use the **buildingPlop** cheat and look for exemplars starting at **KOSC\_SG\_LargeCostcoWithGas (requires ExtraCheats.dll).**

    **Install Instructions**

    Drop the files in your **My Documents/SimCity 4/Plugins** folder. To uninstall, simply delete the files from your hard drive.

    **General Stats**

    The included lots will provide **591 CS$$** jobs. They are available in the following configuration:

    -   2 10x10 left corner, stage 1
    -   1 10x10 right corner, stage 1

    Stats were generated with PIM\-X, and coincide with the revised model pack version found on SC4D.

    Detailed stats and information can be found in the enclosed README.

    **Install Instructions**

    Drop the files in your **My Documents/SimCity 4/Plugins** folder.
