    *KOSC presents: **Diego Del Llano's Puerto Vallarta Growables - Icon Vallarta***

    **Introduction**

    **Diego's Puerto Vallarta** **Growables** is a new series of re-lots featuring [@Diego Del Llano](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/199222-diego-del-llano/)'s fantastic BATs that were based in his hometown. As quite of few of these buildings had their bases graciously removed for lotting, I've decided to take another step beyond just converting them into growables. This first release will cover **Icon Vallarta**, a luxurious condo building located on the beachfront in Puerto Vallarta.

    **Package Overview**

    The building was lotted in several different configurations, from your typical small footprint growable to a massive two and three tower complex. Some lots take advantage of the fact that the real-life version is located in a tropical climate. Thus, several lot will have palm trees and tropical plants as its primary flora source. The layout of the largest complex in particular is loosely based off its actual real-life counterpart from the layout of the entrances down to the relative placement of the pool and the buildings.

    Included in the following package are a total of 5 lots: All are R§§§ growables.

    **General Stats**

    The included growable lots will provide occupancy anywhere from **915 R§§§ to 2738 R****§§§** sims, based on the number of buildings in the lot. The lots themselves are offered in the following configurations.

    -   3x2 front, stage 8; 3x3 front, stage 7; 4x4 left corner, stage 7 for the **single** tower variant
    -   6x8 front, stage 6 for the **dual** tower variant
    -   6x10 front, stage 7 for the **triple** tower variant

    Detailed stats and information can be found in the enclosed README.

    **Install Instructions**

    Drop the files in your **My Documents/SimCity 4/Plugins** folder. Since the original buildings used separate IDs for both the MaxisNite and DarkNite models, two separate zips are included at your convenience.
