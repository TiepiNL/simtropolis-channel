    *KOSC presents: **ITS Office Parks -** **CIS Center***

    **Introduction**

    Let's go bigger! CIS Center is a MEGAlot combining two individual Ill Tonkso releases: CIS Tower Manchester and CIS Tower 2 Manchester. Like their namesake, the two buildings have a similar design and theme which is why I thought they would look great as one massive plaza.

    **Package Overview**

    CIS Center is an urban centric office park/plaza with a major tower and two smaller towers. The focal point is the marble-paved plaza facing the main tower directly, with tree lined pathways as well as several fountains. Tucked away to the sides are narrower pathways shaded by massive deciduous trees as well as the looming offices above. Finally, lost in the back is a small service parking lot. Most workers choose instead to park in large garages across the street instead.

    This package contains a **growable** and a **ploppable** (it "grows" too!). Both lots share the same stats. Do note that these lots are of considerable size and capacity, so you'll need to make sure to have adequate demand/power/water and to a lesser extent, police coverage.

    **General Stats** (**Growable and Ploppable)**

    ***CIS Center***

    *Growth Stage: 7*

    *Lot Size: 8x13 (Front)*
