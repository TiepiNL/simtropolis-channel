  summary: ITS Office Parks - Tonkso Corporate Park, Trowbridge Offices
  description: |-
    *KOSC presents: **Tonkso Corporate Park, Trowbridge Offices***  
      
    **Introduction**  
      
    This is the third set of lots in my **ITS Office Park** series. Tonsko Corporate Park is the suburban counterpart to my previous urban release, the Ill Tonkso Plaza. Like it, this release consists of multiple buildings on one lot, to achieve a cohesive, monotonous design often found in very large office campuses. It just so happens that nearly every one of Ill Tonkso's old midrise fit this mold almost perfectly.

    **Package Overview**

    **Trowbridge Offices** is a standalone office complex featuring 3 of **Ill Tonkso's** **Trowbridge Houses**. This lot features a central pool with tree shaded walkways in-between the buildings. The highlight is the 2-phase **Tonkso Corporate Park**, featuring large, spacious parking lots dotted with seasonal trees as well as large open lawn spaces. The 2-piece set can be rotated and placed together to create a full complex seamlessly.

    Included in the following package are 3 different lot configurations. There are a total of 3 growables versions as well as their counterpart ploppables, located in the landmarks menu.

    If you've downloaded any of my previous ITS Office Park lots, you should have most if not all of the required texture/prop dependencies.
