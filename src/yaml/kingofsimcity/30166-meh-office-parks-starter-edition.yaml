  description: |-
    **Overview:**  
    This is the first set in an attempt to expand Maxis' current kit of low-midrises into a larger complex of homogeneous buildings, similar to the structure of many suburban office parks in North America. The lots are designed to grow on large (>=5x5) plots of land such that there should be no interference by standard Maxis fare. The package contains 3 different lot designs on 2 buildings for a total of 6 lots.  
      
    **Building Stats:**  
    **Modde Business Park (Modde Inc.) (2x/3x)**  
    *2x Capacity: 506 CO$$$ jobs / 722 CO$$ when dilapidated  
    3x Capacity: 757 CO$$$ jobs / 1082 CO$$ when dilapidated*  
    *Houston Tileset*  
       
    **Techtronics Office Park (Galvin Techtronics) (2x/3x)**  
    *2x Capacity: 555 CO$$$ jobs / 793 CO$$ when dilapidated  
    3x Capacity: 831 CO$$$ jobs / 1187 CO$$ when dilapidated*  
    *Euro Tileset*  
       
    All buildings can grow starting at *Low Density* and have basic BTE tracking enabled. Note that the clusters have higher capacities than the individual combined components of their vanilla counterparts. This is a result of how capacities are computed in PIM\-X with regards to filling degree.  
      
    **Possible Lot Configurations****/Stages**  
    **5x5** (2 Buildings, Stage 4, Left Corner), **8x8 MEGA** (3 Buildings, Stage 3, Front), **6x8** (3 Buildings, Stage 3**,** Right Corner)

    The lots are designed to complement vanilla/Maxis SC4 and as such require no external dependencies other than Maxis Buildings as Props (bldgprop\_vol1 and vol2). I HIGHLY recommend using [TWrecks' Maxis Prop Names and Query Fix](https://community.simtropolis.com/index.php?app=downloads&module=downloads&controller=view&id=22400) instead, as querying the periphery buildings will highlight the whole complex.
