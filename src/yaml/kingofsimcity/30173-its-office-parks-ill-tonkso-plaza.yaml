    *KOSC presents: **ITS Office Parks -** **Ill Tonkso Plaza***

    **Introduction**

    Its time to break the monotony of Maxis themed office parks! Today I'm introducing *Ill Tonkso Plaza,* a massive multi-MEGAlot complex as a tribute to one of my favorite BATers and his kit of incredible midrise buildings, a category in SC4 that was fairly neglected back then. Like with my Maxis sets, the office parks consists of multiple like/unlike buildings on one lot with a cohesive theme/design. However, I've decided to break free from the Maxis mold since the default textures just absolutely do NOT do justice to these buildings.

    **Package Overview**

    Ill Tonkso Plaza is a large office complex suited for both upscale suburban office parks and well as serving as a stopgap between downtown and the 'burbs. The complex consists of lots in 3 'phases': when zoned/plopped in a special layout, the three lots will merge together seamlessly. This package contains 6 total lots: **3** growables and **3** ploppables (with an alternate texture scheme).

    **General Stats** (**Growable and Ploppable)**

    ***Phase 1*** ***(2x Sutton/1x CitySet)***

    *Lot Size: 9x9 (Front)*

    *Capacity: 2733 CO$$$ / *3907 CO$$ when dilapidated**

    *Power/Water: 110/1187*

    *Plop Cost: $20,456*

    ***Phase 2*** ***(2x DR Pawley)***

    *Lot Size: 5x7 (Right Corner)*

    *Capacity: 1125 CO$$$ / *1607 CO$$ when dilapidated**

    *Power/Water: 45/497*

    *Plop Cost: $12,542*

    ***Phase 3*** ***(2x CitySet)***

    *Lot Size: 7x8 (Left Corner)*

    *Capacity: 1300 CO$$$ / *1858 CO$$ when dilapidated**

    *Power/Water: 53/572*

    *Plop Cost: $14,950*

    All buildings can grow on both Euro and Houston tileset. Growables also have BTE tracking enabled.

    **Dependencies**

    As a departure from my mostly Maxis-centric lots, there are quite a few dependencies. However, most of them should be rather common so don't fret! ![*:)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/default_1.gif ":)")
