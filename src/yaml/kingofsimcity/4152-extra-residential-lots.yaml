#   summary: Extra Residential Lots
#   description: |-
#     There Are 9 Files Included In this Zip.

#     Ong Condos 6x6

#     Byall Tower 5x5

#     The Chandler 4x6

#     Martin Apartments 4x6

#     Buencher Apartments 4x6

#     Twin Peak Towers 4x5

#     Quigley Place 6x4

#     McCarthy Condos 6x4

#     Idylic View Condominium 3x4

#     These Are Extra Lots and do not replace the originals. I found out there were lack of 6x6, 5x5, 4x6, 6x4 5x6, and 6x5 lots so Here are some. Commercial Office Version will be coming out soon. Best Used If You Have A large Population and Always Get the Same Buildings. :-)
