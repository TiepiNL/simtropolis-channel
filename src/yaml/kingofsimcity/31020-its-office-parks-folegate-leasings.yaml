    *KOSC presents: **Folegate Leasings***

    **Introduction**

    This is the **10th** set of lots in my **ITS Office Park** series. **Folegate Leasings** is a set of ugly little fictional headquarters brought slightly back to life. Urghhhhh. Absolutely perfect for your generic, boring suburban business park.

    **Package Overview**

    **Folegate Leasings** comes with several different growable configurations and orientations. Like Holbourne House, this set comes with a centerpiece ploppable - a massive 11x9 monstrosity with 3 buildings. Similarly, all growable lots also boast parking lots with multiple entrances and were designed for expansion in mind. These were made to be combined with my **SP Modular Parking Set**.  
      
    Included in the following package are a total of **10** lots: 8 CO$$ growables, 1 CO$$ growable and one CO$$ ploppable. These range from small, urban-friendly combinations to fairly large complexes. There are two different packages, the standard version and a **LITE** version. The LITE version is an adaptation that removes a lot of the perimeter CP seasonal trees and emphasizes open space and user preference. These were specifically made to cater to users that prefer their own choice of MMP trees and plants.

    If you do need to plop the growables, use the **buildingPlop** cheat and look for exemplars starting at **KOSC ITS \_\_buildingName\_\_ (requires ExtraCheats.dll)**
