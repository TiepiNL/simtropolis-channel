    *KOSC presents: **East Point Offices***

    **Introduction**  
      
    This is the seventh set of lots in my **ITS Office Park** series.  **East Point Offices** focuses on my original goal for the series, which was a collection of small to large size lots to create dozens of different office park configurations. You may also notice a slight style change with this one (and everything after!); with the exception of a few lots, everything is now fully seasonal. In addition, the parking lots have also been slightly tuned up as well. (*thanks nos.17! ![*:P](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/default_3.gif ":P"))*

    **Package Overview**  
      
    **East Point Offices** is a collection of growable office lots built from Ill Tonksoâ€™s **East Point** BAT. Lots range from tight plazas lined with palm trees to massive, seasonal tree lined parking lots. The larger ones especially feature plenty of open grass space and even ponds and fountains.  
    Included in the following package are a total of **13** lots, all of which are **CO$$ growables.** Each lot contains up to 3 office buildings. There are **7 lots with 1 building, 4 lots with 2 buildings, and 2 lots with 3 buildings.** Refer to the screenshots for the required zoning layout.
