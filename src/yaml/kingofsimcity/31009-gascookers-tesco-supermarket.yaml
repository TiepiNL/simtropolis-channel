    *KOSC presents: RetailMania - gascooker's Tesco Supermarket*

    **Introduction**  
      
    Welcome to RetailMania, where I will attempt to breathe realism and new life into retail BATs.

    **Tesco Supermarket** is the first release of my **RetailMania** series and is a direct relot of **gascooker's UK 24 Hour Tesco Supermarket**.

    **Package Overview**  
      
    This set of lots expands the supermarket to feature a full car park including handicapped spots, cart return areas and bonus greenery. These lots were designed with the UK in mind, so everything you see is LHD-based, and contain UK-style road marking and parking stall styles.  
      
    Included in the following package are a total of **2** growable versions. Lot sizes include 7x8 and 6x9.

    **Note that these are based off the original descriptor, and as such contain the same stats as the original release.**

    To plop them with ExtraCheats, look for "Tesco 24Hr" as the beginning of the exemplar name.

    **Install Instructions**

    Drop the files in your **My Documents/SimCity 4/Plugins** folder.
