info:
  summary: "A DLL Plugin for SimCity 4 that adds a cheat code to convert plopped buildings to a growable RCI zone type."
  conflicts: "Only compatible with game version 1.1.641, the Windows digital edition."
  description: |
    This mod is an in-game equivalent to the SC4 command line tool's growify command for editing save games (and the website version).

    One of the differences between the two tools is the building exemplar property that is used to detect the RCI building type.
    The SC4 command line tool uses the Capacity Satisfied property from the savegame's lot subfile.
    This plugin uses the Purpose property from the building's exemplar.
