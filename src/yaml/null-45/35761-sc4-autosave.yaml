info:
  summary: "A DLL Plugin for SimCity 4 that automatically saves a city at user-specified intervals. "
  conflicts: "Only compatible with game version 1.1.641, the Windows digital edition."
  description: |
    This auto-save plugin does not require any launcher and will work with any digital Windows version of the game, Steam, GOG, etc. The disc-based versions should also work if fully patched.

    If you use a 3rd-party launcher that has its own auto-save setting you will need to disable that option when installing this plugin. 
    
    For more information visit the mod download page

  warning: |-
    This DLL plugin comes with one INI configuration file:

    * `SC4AutoSave.ini``

    To complete the installation, copy these files from the package subfolder into the root directory of your Plugins folder and edit them to set your preferences.
