info:
  summary: "A DLL Plugin for SimCity 4 that removes phantom items from the budget department lists."
  conflicts: "Only compatible with game version 1.1.641, the Windows digital edition."
  description: |
    This DLL only removes the phantom budget entries, it does not remove the buildings, lots, or other in-game effects such as the Landmark or Park effects. 
    
    *Using the Plugin*

    The plugin adds a RemovePhantomBudgetItems cheat code with the following syntax

    RemovePhantomBudgetItems <category> [all]

    The <category> parameter is one of Fire, Police, Jail, Power, Education or Health.
    The [all] parameter is optional, it makes the plugin to clear the specified budget category instead of only entries associated with plugin(s) that no longer exist. The [all] parameter is intended to be used if phantom budget items remain in the budget menu after demolishing all existing buildings in the specified category.

    All commands are case-insensitive.

    To complete the installation, copy these files from the package subfolder into the root directory of your Plugins folder and edit them to set your preferences.
