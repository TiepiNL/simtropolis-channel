info:
  summary: "A DLL Plugin for SimCity 4 that adds a Humane Society ordinance to the game."
  conflicts: "Only compatible with game version 1.1.641, the Windows digital edition."
  description: |
    This ordinance is based on the Humane Society ordinance suggestion in this post, and has the following properties:

    Availability Requirements At least 1 hospital or clinic. The original suggestion did not include this, but I think it makes sense given the per hospital/clinic cost.
    Expense Base cost of $-50/month plus $-5 per hospital/clinic.
    Effects

    * Increases mayor rating by 5 points.
    * Reduces crime by 5%.
