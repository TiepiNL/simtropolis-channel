info:
  summary: "A DLL Plugin for SimCity 4 that disables the demolition animation."
  conflicts: "Only compatible with game version 1.1.641, the Windows digital edition."
  description: |
    Before SC4 picks the demolition animation to use for an occupant, it calls a function to determine if the occupant is too small for a demolition animation. This DLL Plugin patches the game's memory to redirect that function call to its own version of the function, which always reports that the occupant is too small for a demolition animation. This has the effect of disabling the demolition animations for all occupants.
