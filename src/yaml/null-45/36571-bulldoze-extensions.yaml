info:
  summary: "A DLL Plugin for SimCity 4 that extends the bulldoze tool."
  conflicts: "Only compatible with game version 1.1.641, the Windows digital edition."
  description: |
    This plugin adds two new modes to the bulldoze tool that control which item types it demolishes.

    *Flora Bulldoze Mode*

    This mode is activated in the city view using a Control + B shortcut, this can be done with or without the bulldoze tool active. When the flora bulldoze mode is active, the bulldoze tool will only affect objects the game considers flora.

    *Network Bulldoze Mode*

    This mode is activated in the city view using a Shift + B shortcut, this can be done with or without the bulldoze tool active. When the network bulldoze mode is active, the bulldoze tool will only affect transportation networks (excluding power lines and water pipes).
