info:
  summary: "A DLL Plugin for SimCity 4 that disables the smoke that is shown after plopping a lot."
  conflicts: "Only compatible with game version 1.1.641, the Windows digital edition."
  description: |
    The method that the game uses to place a lot takes a Boolean parameter that controls whether the smoke effect is shown.
    
    When that method is called by the lot placement UI tool it hard-codes that parameter to true, the plugin patches the game's memory to change it to false.
