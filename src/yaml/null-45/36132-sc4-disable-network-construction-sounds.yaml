info:
  summary: "A DLL Plugin for SimCity 4 that disables the sounds that are played during the network construction animation."
  conflicts: "Only compatible with game version 1.1.641, the Windows digital edition."
  description: |
    The plugin patches the game's memory to make it skip playing the jackhammer sound track that is normally used during the animation.

    Note that this will also disable 2 in-game messages that are sent at the start and end of the animation sequence. The messages are
    
    *kSC4MsgConstructionRoadCrewStart (0x89F10866) and kSC4MsgConstructionRoadCrewEnd (0xA9F10E45).*
